If someone's building isn't controlled quickly, they may develop a life threatening condition called shock and they may become a responsive. Building for the mouth or nose may affect the breathing. So try to ensure that the airways get clear. I will start today where it can be a cause for a causality to become a responsive. If the causality becomes a responsive at any point, open the airway and check the breathing and prepare the treatment and a responsive causality.

If the wound is covered by clothing, we move or cut the clothes to arm cover the wound. the room. Is there an object in the room? If there is, don't pull it out because it may be acting as a plow to reduce the bleeding. Instead, leave it in and apply pressure on either side of it to push the edges together. If this is an object in the room, apply direct pressure on the room with your fingers and use a stellar dressing or clean non-flotty pad to stop the bleeding. If you don't have a dressing, ask the causality to apply direct pressure themselves to stop the bleeding. Jenny, can you pay for some pressure for me, please? Brilliant, excellent, no done.

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins.

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients.

Before sampling, confirm the patient's identity. If a recent change in ventilator setting has been made, wait approximately 20 to 30 minutes before sampling. that the arterial line is functioning properly. Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

      "answer": "To apply pressure on a wound effectively, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess the Wound**: First, evaluate the wound to determine if there is an object embedded in it. If so, do not remove the object, as it may be preventing further bleeding. Instead, leave it in place.\n\n2. **Apply Pressure**: Use your fingers to apply direct pressure on the wound. If the object is present, apply pressure on either side of it to help push the edges of the wound together. This can help control bleeding by reducing the space for blood to escape [Video 2: NxO5LvgqZe0, Time: 01:47-01:49].\n\n3. **Maintain Pressure**: Keep the pressure applied continuously. If blood soaks through your initial dressing, do not remove it; instead, add more layers on top while maintaining pressure.\n\n4. **Monitor the Patient**: Watch for signs of shock, such as unresponsiveness or difficulty breathing. If the bleeding does not stop or if the patient's condition worsens, seek emergency medical assistance immediately [Video 1].\n\nRemember to always wash your hands before and after treating a wound to prevent infection, and use gloves if available.",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done!

This is crucial before moving on to packing the wound [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38].\n\n2. **Prepare the Gauze**: If bleeding persists, prepare to pack the wound with gauze. You can use hemostatic gauze, standard gauze, or even a clean shirt if gauze is unavailable [Video 2: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 01:12-01:17].\n\n3. **Pack the Wound**: Take the gauze and gently pack it into the wound. Continue to pack until you cannot fit any more gauze, ensuring that you are reaching the source of the bleeding. This step is essential to help control the hemorrhage effectively [Video 2].\n\n4. **Monitor the Patient**: After packing the wound, keep monitoring the patient for any signs of shock or continued bleeding. If bleeding does not stop, further interventions may be necessary.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always ensure that your hands are clean or use gloves if available",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

This is very simple, but you need to know how to do it, because if you do it wrong, you can actually end up hurting yourself. Exactly, so all right. Let's start off with the first thing you want to do is you actually with most of these crutches now They have a little push pin here And there's actually some numbers along here like this for example goes all the way from five one to five nine So it's a good starting point if you're five nine Go ahead and set it up at five nine That's the push the buttons in it's a telescoping needle where and I was like the turret just a little bit and then you can slide that up and down But you gotta get those holes lined up so they click and the button pops out just like that. And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms",

And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant. Just put the turnicant on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super, super tight. Then we're going to take the handle. We're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it. And we're going to write the time.

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze.

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

      "answer": "To effectively pack a wound, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Apply Pressure**: Start by applying direct pressure to the wound to help control the bleeding. This is the first crucial step in managing a bleeding patient [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38].\n\n2. **Wound Packing**: If bleeding continues despite applying pressure, proceed to pack the wound. Use hemostatic gauze if available; otherwise, any clean gauze or even a shirt can be utilized. Take the gauze and firmly pack it into the wound until it cannot be packed any further. This step is vital as it helps to reach the source of the bleeding [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 01:12-01:17].\n\n3. **Consider a Tourniquet**: If the bleeding does not stop with packing, the next step is to apply a tourniquet above the wound site, if necessary. This should be done only if the previous steps fail to control the bleeding.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that the materials used for packing are clean to minimize the risk of infection. Always seek professional medical help as soon as possible after",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

If you get pain kind of reaching up an overhead or just with certain shoulder motions in general, oftentimes it's because of that rotator calf.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side.

It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Assess the peripheral veins for any previous attempts or conditions that may affect access [Video 2: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 02:31-02:36].\n\n2. **Select the Right Tourniquet**: Use a pressure cuff or a standard tourniquet. If using a pressure cuff, set it to approximately 90 mmHg, which is below the diastolic pressure. This pressure helps engorge the veins, making them larger and more visible [Video 3: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 03:24-03:26].\n\n3. **Apply the Tourniquet**: Place the tourniquet around the upper arm or leg, ensuring it is snug but not too tight to cause discomfort or tissue damage. Monitor the patient for any signs of excessive pressure.\n\n4. **Observe for Vein Distension**: Wait a few moments for the veins to distend. This should improve the visibility of the veins, making it easier to locate",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few",

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins.

Discard all sharps, such as used needles, syringes, and potential sharps like glass items into a puncture resistant sharps-waste container. Place other items like used gloves and all items contaminated with blood or body fluids into the infectious waste bag. Recheck labels and requisition forms for accuracy. Perform hand hygiene. Monitor the site and extremity for a while for any sign of circulatory problems, nerve damage, or any other complications. To practice drawing arterial blood with the venapukshar trainer, do the following. Fill a ten milliliter syringe with fake blood and connect to the smaller vein and let it run through the tube. Now tightly occlude one side of the smaller vein. Ask a person to sit opposite from you and have them press down on the plunger of the syringe with moderate pulsating pressure to simulate the pulsations of an artery. Perform the simulation procedure for drawing arterial blood.",

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with",

      "answer": "To enlarge veins for injection, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Ensure the patient's arm is either hanging down or positioned horizontally. This prevents blood from draining away from the upper extremity, which helps keep the veins fuller and more visible [Video 3: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 07:16-07:22].\n\n2. **Application of a Tourniquet**: Use an S mark bandage or a similar tourniquet technique. The application of this bandage is crucial as it directly influences the success of locating peripheral veins. Proper application can help visualize veins on the dorsal side of the wrist and hand [Video 2: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 07:39-07:44].\n\n3. **Ultrasound Assistance**: While ultrasound can be helpful for deep veins, it is not as effective for small peripheral veins. Therefore, rely more on visual inspection and palpation for smaller veins [Video 1: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 04:21-04:25].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Avoid elevating the arm during the procedure, as this",

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins.

Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay.

Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds.

Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in three dimensions. In your dominant hand, take the syringe with exposed needle attached and hold it like a pencil, approach the skin at 30 to 45 degrees in line with the radial artery, pointing toward the elbow. The needle should enter the radial artery immediately below the gloved fingers of the non-dominant hand. Keep the skin taught and enter the skin with a brisk movement. Once in the soft tissue, gently advance the needle to where you think the radial artery is. It is easy to go straight through the radial artery if you rush, you may feel a slight give as the needle penetrates the wall of the radial artery. Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe.",

This helps reduce anxiety and sympathetic outflow, which can constrict veins [Video 1: 03:24-03:26].\n\n2. **Application of the Esmarch Bandage**: Use an Esmarch bandage to apply pressure to the limb. The pressure should be set at around 90 millimeters of mercury, just below the diastolic pressure. This helps engorge the veins, making them more visible [Video 1: 03:24-03:26].\n\n3. **Observation**: As you apply the bandage, observe the dorsal and volar sides of the wrist and hand. The success of this technique is directly proportional to how effectively the bandage is applied. You should start to see peripheral veins becoming more prominent [Video 3: 07:39-07:44].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Monitor the patient for any signs of discomfort or complications. Ensure that the pressure is not too high to avoid compromising blood flow.\n\nBy following these steps, you can enhance your ability to",

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this.

Now, I don't know how long your arms are. So you might have to grab underneath like this. Yep. You might grab a bob like this. You might actually need a towel. Sure. There's one right there, brother. Oh, you want me to use that towel. Yeah. So you can actually have the towel in bed with you and you can just pull up like this and give it a stretch like that. Particularly for some people that are a little older, I'm depending on your body proportions, it's, you know, you need that extra help.

      "answer": "To reset forward rounded shoulders using a towel and a doorframe, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Towel**: Take a towel and roll it up to create a thicker cylinder. This thickness is crucial as it helps in proper shoulder alignment. Aim for a thickness of about 3 to 4 inches to facilitate better rotation [Video 2: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 09:56-10:02].\n\n2. **Position the Towel**: Tuck the rolled towel into your side. This will serve as a pivot point for your shoulder as you perform the exercise [Video 3: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 08:40-08:44].\n\n3. **Use the Doorframe**: Stand in a doorframe and place your forearms against the frame. This position will help stretch the chest and open up the shoulders.\n\n4. **Rotate Away**: Gently rotate your body away from the doorframe while keeping the towel in place. This motion should feel natural and help in correcting the shoulder position.\n\n**Safety Note**: This exercise is not recommended for individuals with shoulder instability, rotator cuff issues, or those who have undergone shoulder",

I'm going to take my right hand, I'm going to place on the opposite side of the door frame and I'm going to pull into my body weight, I should say, into the door frame. You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level. Once you hit that, this is going to be the next part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch, and I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds, I'm going to then relax, and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next",

My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

Then you're going to bring the crutch around from your unaffected side to your injured side. Bring the crutches out from underneath your armpits, reach down for the hand grips. With the opposite hand, you're going to reach down for the chair or the bed. If you have a chair rest, it will be easier to reach for that. You kick the affected forward and you have a seat. Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this. Once your crutches are fit correctly and you're standing up, you're going to bring one crutch around to the other side and stand up tall. Your doctor will let you know how much weight you can put through your leg. For this video, I'm demonstrating not putting any weight through my injured leg. You're going to bring your crutches forward first, swing the affected or injured leg forward first, and then take a small step with your good leg. forward, step.

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients.

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time.

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

      "answer": "To improve blood flow and treat varicose veins by raising your legs, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Lie down on your back on a flat surface. Elevate your legs above the level of your heart. This can be achieved by propping your legs up on a wall or using cushions. This position helps reduce pressure in the veins of your legs, allowing blood to flow back towards your heart more efficiently.\n\n2. **Leg Raises**: Perform straight leg raises while your legs are elevated. Pull your toes towards you to help straighten out your legs. Hold the raised position for a few seconds to enhance blood circulation. This exercise engages your leg muscles and utilizes gravity to assist in venous return [Video 2: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 00:41-00:47; Video 3: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n3. **Duration**: Aim to keep your legs elevated for 15-30 minutes several times a day, especially after prolonged periods of standing or sitting.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise regimen, especially if you have existing health conditions",

This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax.

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now.

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay.

You can prop one leg up if needed for comfort [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n2. **Leg Movement**: Begin with a straight leg raise. Lift one leg straight up while keeping the other leg flat on the surface. This helps engage the muscles in your leg.\n\n3. **Toe Positioning**: Pull your toes up towards you as you raise your leg. This action helps to straighten out your leg and can enhance muscle engagement, which is beneficial for blood flow [Video 1].\n\n4. **Hold Position**: Once your leg is raised, hold it at the top for a moment. This pause is crucial as it encourages blood to flow back down towards the heart, utilizing gravity to assist in circulation [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repetition**: Repeat this exercise several times for both legs to promote effective blood circulation.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you perform these exercises in a controlled manner to avoid strain or injury.

If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair. But just lift your heels up off the ground and then slowly come back down. So now",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time.

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few",

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with",

Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner.

This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting.

      "answer": "To improve blood flow and treat varicose veins through calf raises or heel raises, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start Position**: Stand with your feet flat on the ground, ensuring you have a stable surface to support yourself. \n\n2. **Calf Raises**: Begin with 10 calf raises. Slowly lift your heels off the ground, rising onto the balls of your feet. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds to allow blood to flow back down through the veins [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 02:06-02:12].\n\n3. **Controlled Movement**: After holding, slowly lower your heels back to the ground. This controlled movement helps engage the calf muscles effectively, promoting venous return.\n\n4. **Progression**: If 10 repetitions become easy, gradually increase the number to 15, 20, or even 25 to enhance muscle engagement and blood flow further [Video 1].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure you maintain good balance while performing these exercises to prevent falls. If you experience any pain or discomfort, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.\n\nIncorporating these calf raises into your routine can significantly aid",

You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax.

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention.

This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event.

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

The folks at MD sent it to me to wear today, and if you're interested in purchasing one, click on the link up there. So let's get on to the next stiffness. This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have",

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee.

So again, if I wanted to hold it, I'd do that chin tuck, look back, hold it for about three to five seconds, come back in and relax. If any of these are painful, don't do it. When you're mobilizing things, you really need to make sure that you don't have something where you shouldn't be mobilizing that spine. So if it hurts in any way, hold off and check in with your doctor or your physical therapist. So the next one that you can do is same kind of motion with the chin touch that said now you're just going to do some turns with it. So this time it's not necessarily the up and over like this nags, but you're just going to do that same kind of motion where you're tucking in the chin.

I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

      "answer": "To perform chin tucks for neck stiffness, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Sit or stand up straight with your shoulders relaxed. Ensure your head is in a neutral position.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck Movement**: Gently pull your chin straight back towards your neck, as if you are trying to create a double chin. Avoid tilting your head up or down; the movement should be horizontal.\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for about 5 seconds, feeling a stretch in the back of your neck. \n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat the chin tuck exercise 10 times, ensuring you breathe normally throughout the exercise.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: If you experience any pain or discomfort while performing the chin tucks, stop the exercise immediately. It\u2019s important to listen to your body and only proceed if the exercise feels comfortable and beneficial [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 00:53-00:56].\n\nThis exercise can help alleviate neck stiffness by strengthening the neck muscles and improving posture. Always consult with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns regarding neck pain or stiffness.",

You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

I'd have them do this and they go oh that kind of hurts It just doesn't feel that good. Yep. So then we would go to the towel and And they would take it home, they'd use the towel for a couple of days and they come back. And by then they were almost ready to do it without the towel then. Yeah, even no towel pain with the towel, less pain, more range of motion. But still not all the way, you know, we're looking for full extension. Our end goal is that you can do it without the towel and you have full motion. That's your end goal. However you get there. You might use a mix of of towel and no towel But you can use your hands kind of like this. Your hands sometimes work too. Yeah, little tricks tricks that we'll show you And then we're gonna go on to the last one is just for the rotation now. This was a little tricky It is you can actually rotate right till left and just give a little over pressure on your jaw Always really get lost on these by the way. Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck.",

You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here.

Now, as you do this, the next step. Now, this is not number three. This is a continuation of number two. Get it to share that has a backrest so you can lean into it and then we're going to start throwing some, we call it cervical extension or looking up with support and we find out Both Bob and I have found out that that typically offers a lot of support and relief You can go up like this if that feels better or you can keep it down here And you're gonna go back as far as that feels",

So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side. That's not a bad thing, but we can make it better if we get the towel and maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter. You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

Place the rolled towel behind your neck at the level of the stiff area.\n\n3. **Engage in Movement**: Hold the towel with both hands. Use one hand to pull down while the other hand pulls up and across, creating a stretch in your neck. Maintain this position for about 30 seconds [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:11-03:13].\n\n4. **Switch Sides**: After holding for 30 seconds, switch sides to ensure balanced treatment of both sides of your neck [Video 2].\n\n5. **Monitor Symptoms**: It's crucial to pay attention to how your neck feels during the exercise.

If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

I'd have them do this and they go oh that kind of hurts It just doesn't feel that good. Yep. So then we would go to the towel and And they would take it home, they'd use the towel for a couple of days and they come back. And by then they were almost ready to do it without the towel then. Yeah, even no towel pain with the towel, less pain, more range of motion. But still not all the way, you know, we're looking for full extension. Our end goal is that you can do it without the towel and you have full motion. That's your end goal. However you get there. You might use a mix of of towel and no towel But you can use your hands kind of like this. Your hands sometimes work too. Yeah, little tricks tricks that we'll show you And then we're gonna go on to the last one is just for the rotation now. This was a little tricky It is you can actually rotate right till left and just give a little over pressure on your jaw Always really get lost on these by the way. Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck.",

So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side. That's not a bad thing, but we can make it better if we get the towel and maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter. You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

The folks at MD sent it to me to wear today, and if you're interested in purchasing one, click on the link up there. So let's get on to the next stiffness. This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have",

      "answer": "To perform neck extensions using a towel to alleviate neck stiffness, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Towel**: Roll a towel into a cylindrical shape. This will serve as a support for your neck during the exercise [Video 1: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Sit or stand comfortably. Place the rolled towel behind your neck, ensuring it supports the base of your skull.\n\n3. **Performing the Extension**: Gently lean your head backward against the towel. This motion should be slow and controlled. Focus on extending your neck without forcing it [Video 1].\n\n4. **Monitor Pain Levels**: If you experience any pain or discomfort while performing the extension, stop immediately. It\u2019s crucial to only continue if the exercise feels beneficial and improves your symptoms. If it worsens, cease the activity [Video 1: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n5. **Breathing**: Incorporate deep breathing while performing the exercise to help relax your muscles, which can enhance the effectiveness of the stretch [Video 3: N59oOxya",

You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it.

So then we would go to the towel and And they would take it home, they'd use the towel for a couple of days and they come back. And by then they were almost ready to do it without the towel then. Yeah, even no towel pain with the towel, less pain, more range of motion. But still not all the way, you know, we're looking for full extension.

      "answer": "To alleviate neck stiffness using a towel, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Towel**: Roll a towel into a cylindrical shape. This will be used for support during the exercise [Video 1: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Sit or stand comfortably. Hold one end of the towel with one hand, and the other end with the opposite hand, creating tension in the towel.\n\n3. **Perform Neck Turns**: Gently pull down with one hand while simultaneously pulling up and across with the other hand. This action creates a stretch in your neck. Hold this position for about 30 seconds [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:11-03:13].\n\n4. **Switch Sides**: After 30 seconds, switch the towel to the other side and repeat the stretch, ensuring to maintain the same tension [Video 2].\n\n5. **Listen to Your Body**: If you experience pain while turning your neck, avoid that direction and only stretch towards the side that feels comfortable. Deep breathing can also help relax your muscles during this process [Video 3",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

The folks at MD sent it to me to wear today, and if you're interested in purchasing one, click on the link up there. So let's get on to the next stiffness. This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here.

You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too.

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this.

It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on",

So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all.

You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too.

Now, as you do this, the next step. Now, this is not number three. This is a continuation of number two. Get it to share that has a backrest so you can lean into it and then we're going to start throwing some, we call it cervical extension or looking up with support and we find out Both Bob and I have found out that that typically offers a lot of support and relief You can go up like this if that feels better or you can keep it down here And you're gonna go back as far as that feels",

The folks at MD sent it to me to wear today, and if you're interested in purchasing one, click on the link up there. So let's get on to the next stiffness. This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

Some people even just start by getting up on their elbow to get used to it but the key to this is not to have your pelvis come above the bed or the floor. That means that it's your back is so tight that it actually does need stretching. So you just work in the range that allows you. And then eventually you might be able to go up this far. If you're still coming off like this, go up to the point where it allows you to go and stop right there and go back down again. Again, this should not create pain, particularly a sharp pain if it does skip it. You might feel a little bit of discomfort when you first start that Brad. You know, I mean, given a few repetitions.

Identify the side of your neck that feels stiff; for example, if it's the left side, you'll stretch that area.\n\n2. **Hand Placement**: Take your left hand and place it on the back of your head or neck for support. This helps to stabilize the area you are stretching [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 07:27-07:29].\n\n3. **Stretching Motion**: Gently pull your head down towards your left shoulder while simultaneously using your right hand to pull down and across, enhancing the stretch. This dual action increases the effectiveness of the stretch [Video 3: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:11-03:13].\n\n4. **Duration**: Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds. Focus on breathing deeply and relaxing into the stretch [Video 3].\n\n5. **Switch Sides**: After 30 seconds, switch to the right side and repeat the process.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you do not overstretch or cause pain.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

Try taking a hot shower since the steam of water can help massage your neck and relax your muscles.

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on",

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using chin tucks and a towel or strap, you can incorporate specific stretching techniques. Start by performing chin tucks, which involve gently retracting your chin towards your neck. This exercise helps to strengthen the deep neck flexors and improve posture, potentially alleviating pain.\n\nFor added relief, you can use a towel or strap. Roll a towel and place it behind your neck while gently pulling down with one hand and pulling up and across with the other hand. This creates a stretch in the neck muscles, which can help alleviate tension. Hold this position for about 30 seconds before switching sides to ensure balanced stretching on both sides of the neck [Video 1: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09; Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:11-03:13].\n\nIn summary, combining chin tucks with towel or strap stretches can effectively relieve neck pain by enhancing flexibility and reducing muscle tension. Always ensure that these exercises do not exacerbate your symptoms; if they do, discontinue use.",

You can also alternate between a cold compress and a heating pad for 20 minutes each to reduce swelling and numb the pain. Try taking a hot shower since the steam of water can help massage your neck and relax your muscles. If your pain persists, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxin. See a doctor if the cricking your neck doesn't go away after two to three days.",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand.

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it.

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip. If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring loaded land set that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the bone so it releases the land set to pump your skin for the blood sample. So often as",

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using neck rotation, you can perform gentle movements such as rocking your head from side to side and rolling your head in a circular motion. This technique helps to alleviate tension and work out any knots in the neck muscles. It is important to execute these movements slowly and stop if you experience any pain [Video 1: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29]. \n\nAdditionally, incorporating stretches can be beneficial. For instance, you can stretch the side of your neck that feels tight by placing your hand on the back of your head and gently pulling down, which can help to alleviate stiffness in the upper neck and back area [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 07:27-07:29]. \n\nIn summary, neck rotation combined with gentle stretching can effectively relieve neck pain. Always listen to your body and avoid any movements that cause discomfort. If pain persists, consider consulting a healthcare professional for further evaluation.",

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade.

If you get pain kind of reaching up an overhead or just with certain shoulder motions in general, oftentimes it's because of that rotator calf. The rotator calf is not strong enough to keep that the ball squarely seated in your socket. Over time, that can lead to pain and pinching and inflammation irritation, even like a rotator calf tear, which we absolutely want to avoid. If we do the right exercises for it, we actually",

It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture.

You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those.

This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side.

This allows for better visibility and access to the biceps.\n\n2. **Inspection**: Begin by visually inspecting the biceps muscle for any asymmetry, swelling, or deformities. Note the contour of the muscle, which consists of both a long and short head. The long head's tendon runs from the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicipital groove of the humerus, making it crucial to examine for signs of irritation or degeneration [Video 1: t8AU9mWIsqI, Time: 00:39-00:41].\n\n3. **Palpation**: Gently palpate the biceps muscle by placing your fingers on the muscle belly, feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Pay special attention to the tendon area, as it is a common site for issues.\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure that the patient is comfortable and inform them about what you are doing during the inspection and palpation to avoid any discomfort or anxiety.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively assess the",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time.

This helps in preventing any skin irritation.\n\n3. **Protect Your Skin**: Always wrap the ice pack or frozen peas in a thin cloth or towel. This prevents direct contact with the skin, which can cause frostbite.\n\n4. **Apply the Ice Pack**: Place the wrapped ice pack on the injured area. Make sure it covers the swollen or painful region adequately.\n\n5. **Timing**: Keep the ice pack on for about 15-20 minutes. This duration is sufficient to help reduce swelling and numb the pain without risking skin damage.\n\n6. **Rest and Repeat**: After removing the ice pack, allow the skin to return to normal temperature before reapplying. You can repeat this process several times a day as needed.\n\nAlways monitor the skin for any adverse",

Once in the soft tissue, gently advance the needle to where you think the radial artery is. It is easy to go straight through the radial artery if you rush, you may feel a slight give as the needle penetrates the wall of the radial artery. Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe. If you don't see blood, you have missed the artery and will have to withdraw the needle somewhat and then re-aign the syringe toward the pulsating artery. Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin.

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide.

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins.

To practice drawing arterial blood with the venapukshar trainer, do the following. Fill a ten milliliter syringe with fake blood and connect to the smaller vein and let it run through the tube. Now tightly occlude one side of the smaller vein. Ask a person to sit opposite from you and have them press down on the plunger of the syringe with moderate pulsating pressure to simulate the pulsations of an artery.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin.

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting. Move side to side for about 20 to 30 reps and repeat it for the five times. Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow stretch. To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity.

If you don't have a dressing, ask the causality to apply direct pressure themselves to stop the bleeding. Jenny, can you pay for some pressure for me, please? Brilliant, excellent, no done. Ask a helper to call 999 or 124 emergency help. Or if you're on your own, use a mobile on speakerphone, so you can keep treating the casualty. Tell the emergency surfaces where the bleeding is coming from and the amount of bleeding. The casualty may leave up shop. So help them to lie down on a blanket or a rug. If there's one to protect them from the coal, we're using support their legs so they are above the level of their heart. Do not wear the leg if it is injured. Can I get a leg down? Thanks. It's going to lift the legs up, is it okay? Secure the dress here with a bandage that is firm enough to maintain the pressure, but doesn't cut off the circulation.

Ensure you have a clean workspace.\n\n2. **Apply Tourniquet**: Place the tourniquet around the upper arm of the trainer to engorge the veins. This makes them more visible and easier to puncture.\n\n3. **Identify Vein**: Palpate the trainer's arm to locate a suitable vein. The median cubital vein is often the best choice.\n\n4. **Disinfect**: Clean the area where you will puncture with an alcohol swab to minimize infection risk.\n\n5. **Insert Needle**: Hold the needle at a 15-30 degree angle and insert it into the vein. Be careful to avoid any sharp injuries; always dispose of used needles properly [Video 1: 71LlfdW548U, Time: 04:06-04:10].\n\n6. **Collect Blood**: Once blood flows into the syringe, withdraw the needle smoothly and apply pressure to the site with a cotton ball to stop bleeding.\n\n7. **Safety Consider",

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few",

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

Pat your skin dry with a clean towel afterward [Video 2: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 02:38-02:45].\n\n2. **Cover Up**: After drying, cover yourself with a towel or clean garment and wait for 15 minutes. This allows your skin to remain clean and dry before applying the wipes [Video 2: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 02:38-02:45].\n\n3. **Application of Wipes**: Remove the garment and apply the CHG wipes directly to the cool, dry skin on your arm and shoulder. Ensure to cover the entire area thoroughly [Video 2: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 02:38-02:45].\n\n4. **Drying Time**: Allow the area to air dry for one minute after application.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few",

This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury. Or another one, such as a couple tunnels in drone, passive, risk flexion and extension. To stretch through risk flexors, point your fingers up in your elbows, extend it nice and straight. Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors. Make sure your arm is nice and straight and your elbow is locked out. This is a great way to mobilize and",

My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with",

And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide.

Pat your skin dry with a clean towel after bathing, and cover yourself with a towel or clean garment while waiting for 15 minutes before applying the wipes [Video 2: 02:38-02:45].\n\n2. **Application**: Use one CHG wipe for both the right and left hip areas. Start by wiping the folds in the abdominal area and groin, ensuring to avoid contact with the genitals [Video 1: 03:50-03:56]. \n\n3. **Technique**: When applying the wipe, ensure you cover the entire area of the hip thoroughly.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Wipe downwards, covering the entire circumference of your leg and foot, ending at the toes. This ensures that all areas are cleaned thoroughly [Video 1: 03:50-03:56].\n\n3. **Repeat for the Other Leg**: After completing the right leg, use another wipe for your left leg and foot, following the same technique. Start at the thigh and move down to the toes, ensuring complete coverage [Video 1: 03:50-03:56].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Avoid using the wipes on the genitals and ensure that you do not apply any powders, deodorants, or lotions after using the wipes, as these can interfere with the cleaning process [Video 3: 02:38-02:45].\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively clean dry",

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

Release the pressure. At the color does not return within 2 seconds, the bandage is too tight. If blood shows will addressing, don't remove it. Just apply a second bandage on top. If bloodshed through both dressings, remove them and apply a fresh bandage, ensuring they's direct pressure applied at the point of bleeding. Support the injured part with a sling or bandage. But check circulation every 10 minutes. Keep monitoring the casualties level of response while waiting for help to arrive. So remember, when treating severe bleeding, wear gloves if available.

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

These wipes help prevent infections and are specifically designed for skin cleansing [Video 1: 01:50-01:56].\n\n2. **Application**: Start by using one CHG wipe to clean the area of your back. It's important to wipe thoroughly, covering the entire area, but avoid contact with sensitive areas like the genitals [Video 1: 03:50-03:56].\n\n3. **Drying**: After applying the wipe, allow the area to air dry for one minute. It is normal for your skin to feel sticky for several minutes after application, but this sensation will dissipate as your skin dries [Video 2: 04:49-04:50].\n\n4. **Post-Care**: Once the skin is dry, dress in clean clothes. Ensure that you discard the used wipes in the trash and do not flush them down the toilet. Avoid using any powders, deodorants, or lotions on the cleaned skin afterward [Video 2: 04:49-04:50].\n\nThese steps will",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe but are now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. TIP FIVE! That's it. A yellow shark's been an out-one or two-ing diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips. How can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?",

If positive, mupirocin will be prescribed as part of your treatment [Video 1: 05:40-05:44].\n\n2. **Application Schedule**: Apply mupirocin ointment twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, for a total of five days. Additionally, apply it once more on the morning of any scheduled surgery [Video 1: 05:40-05:44].\n\n3. **Application Technique**: To apply the ointment, squeeze a small amount onto your fingertip and gently insert it into one nostril. Use your finger to spread the ointment inside the nostril. Repeat this process for the other nostril.\n\n4. **Safety Notes**: Ensure that your hands are clean before and after applying the ointment. Avoid touching your face or other surfaces to prevent spreading bacteria. \n\n5. **Follow-Up**: Monitor for any adverse reactions or side effects, and consult your healthcare",

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

If bloodshed through both dressings, remove them and apply a fresh bandage, ensuring they's direct pressure applied at the point of bleeding. Support the injured part with a sling or bandage. But check circulation every 10 minutes. Keep monitoring the casualties level of response while waiting for help to arrive. So remember, when treating severe bleeding, wear gloves if available. Remove or cut away any clothing from around the womb. Check for objects in the womb, but don't remove them. Apply pressure on either side of the womb. It is not object in the womb, use a dressing or pad, and apply direct pressure to the womb. Call 99 or 1-1-2-4 emergency help. Secure the dressing with a bandage. To do the casualty for shock, support the engine area, keep checking their level of response while waiting for help, and that's how we treat someone with a severe bleed.",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze.

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins.

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level. Once you hit that, this is going to be the next part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch, and I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds, I'm going to then relax, and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next",

You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time, but after a couple days or so and sometimes less, if you use a towel, no, this is a tricky part.

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side. That's not a bad thing, but we can make it better if we get the towel and maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter. You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are",

With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation.

If you want to check out some more, make sure you click on the link up there. So with the standing quad stretch. You can pretty much do this anywhere. You don't have to hold on to anything, but I always say it's best to hold on because then you can focus on your stretches just a little bit more. So with the quad stretch, you really want to get in a good position. I'm going to go ahead and have my timer getting ready to go and I'll just explain as we go along, but it's going to be 30 second stretches, three on each side and we're going to take a little 10 second rest break in between. So I'm going to go ahead and start it and then we'll go along. So with the quad stretch standing, you're just gonna grab your foot and make sure the top part of your leg is straight down. So the important part of that stretch is that that quad is down. If it's here, you're not really gonna",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level. Once you hit that, this is going to be the next part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch, and I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds, I'm going to then relax, and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next",

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip. If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring loaded land set that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the bone so it releases the land set to pump your skin for the blood sample. So often as",

Do this 20 to 30 reps on each direction and also repeat it three to four sets, owner and radial distractions. Grab the end of the wrist with the other hand and slightly pull the wrist joint apart. This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury. Or another one, such as a couple tunnels in drone, passive, risk flexion and extension. To stretch through risk flexors, point your fingers up in your elbows, extend it nice and straight. Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors. Make sure your arm is nice and straight and your elbow is locked out. This is a great way to mobilize and",

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest. To stretch the forearm muscles for golfers elbow, you're going to exaggerate a very slow wave so that palm of your hand lands on the table top and bench where your fingers point backwards. Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

A pig flow meter is easy to use, even children as young as four should be able to perform a pig flow with good results. Let's take a look at how it's done. Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

To descend the stairs, you're going to bring your crutches around to the opposite side as the railing that you're using and take a hold of the handrail with the other hand. To go down, you go down with your crutches first, then your injured leg comes forward, And you put the weight through your hands to step with your left foot. One step at a time. So I'll always remember to follow your doctor's orders as far as how much weight you can put through your injured leg.

You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level. Once you hit that, this is going to be the next part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch, and I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds, I'm going to then relax, and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side. That's not a bad thing, but we can make it better if we get the towel and maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter. You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did.

So this is the first part. I'm going to take my right hand, I'm going to place on the opposite side of the door frame and I'm going to pull into my body weight, I should say, into the door frame. You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level.

So it influences your eye movements, the tone of your voice and facial expressions if you're in a good mood and relaxed and people can see that in your face.

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check out my other videos to see how you can get rid of the pain and get back to doing what you want.",

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

This is very simple, but you need to know how to do it, because if you do it wrong, you can actually end up hurting yourself. Exactly, so all right. Let's start off with the first thing you want to do is you actually with most of these crutches now They have a little push pin here And there's actually some numbers along here like this for example goes all the way from five one to five nine So it's a good starting point if you're five nine Go ahead and set it up at five nine That's the push the buttons in it's a telescoping needle where and I was like the turret just a little bit and then you can slide that up and down But you gotta get those holes lined up so they click and the button pops out just like that. And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms",

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side. That's not a bad thing, but we can make it better if we get the towel and maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter. You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

A pig flow meter is easy to use, even children as young as four should be able to perform a pig flow with good results. Let's take a look at how it's done. Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time, but after a couple days or so and sometimes less, if you use a towel, no, this is a tricky part. Yeah, I'm going to rotate to the right, so I'm going to take my right hand, grab the left tail of the towel, that's on the left shoulder. Up over the jaw and rotate, that's my bump into my mic so you you might hear me scratching scratch a little. Make sure you don't go like I often have you take it up to the eyebrow. Yeah, sure. This one goes almost across the eyelids and I'm trying to keep this shoulder from turning. So this left shoulder I'm keeping it back. I'm not going like this along with the neck. Sometimes they even hook it around the chair. Sure. Yeah, that locks it in. It's It's amazing what this technique does. The support around your low neck, and the...

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair.

This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax.

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level. Once you hit that, this is going to be the next part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch, and I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds, I'm going to then relax, and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next",

While you're doing that, you don't want to hold your back and then your legs. go for a few reps, semi, especially all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, yeah, and relax, relax, relax, that's all, that's all, that's perfect, you want to go for three sets of, you let's say eight to ten, you can try these every and hour or two hours once, yeah, the next move, you're going to go for a single-leg stretch, basically, and lean in the stretch. You can move it forward, you have perfect, and you're trying to maintain your back kind of straight, lean back to the beat, maybe that's cool. Yeah, you don't want to go for a really high stretch, as long as you feel the stretch that you've got. And you can hold that for 10 to 15 seconds, and then you can switch leg, the same routine while you're holding it there, you've been in and out. That's great.

It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here.

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those.

What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those.

We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip. If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring loaded land set that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the bone so it releases the land set to pump your skin for the blood sample. So often as",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

If you draw a line through the middle and the two halves do not match, this asymmetry is a warning sign for melanoma. A benign mole will typically be symmetrical [Video 1: hXYd0WRhzN4, Time: 01:03-01:08].\n\n2. **Border**: Look at the edges of the mole. Benign moles usually have smooth, even borders. If the borders are irregular, scalloped, or notched, this could indicate a problem [Video 1].\n\n3. **Color**: Check for variations in color. A mole that has multiple colors (brown, black, tan, or even red, white, or blue) can be a warning sign.\n\n4. **Diameter**: Measure the size of the mole. If it is larger than 6mm (about the size of a pencil eraser), it may be concerning.\n\n5. **Evolving**: Monitor any changes in the mole over time, including size, shape, color, or elevation.\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, it",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those.

Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling.

Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

Your forearm should be perpendicular to your torso [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:53-05:00].\n\n3. **Movement**: While maintaining the elbow position, rotate your forearm upward, away from your body, against resistance (such as a dumbbell or resistance band).

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front",

And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden",

Keep your head aligned with your spine for good posture [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:53-05:00].\n\n2. **Elbow Placement**: Bend your elbow to a 90-degree angle, keeping it close to your body. This position is crucial to isolate the internal rotators effectively [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 06:15-06:19].\n\n3. **Movement**: Holding a light dumbbell in your hand, rotate your forearm inward towards your abdomen while keeping your elbow stationary. Focus on controlled movements to ensure quality of motion, which is essential for effective training [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 10:34-10:40].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10-15 repetitions, ensuring that you maintain good posture throughout the exercise",

My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those.

Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair.

Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front",

Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

Ensure your shoulders are back, head high, and chest elevated. This alignment is crucial for effective movement and injury prevention [Video 3: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 10:34-10:40].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Attach a resistance band or cable at waist height. Hold the band with your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle, keeping it close to your body. Your forearm should be parallel to the ground [Video 3].\n\n3. **Execution**: Pull the band or cable away from your body, rotating your forearm outward while maintaining the elbow's position. Focus on the quality of the motion rather than just the resistance. Ensure that your elbow can stray slightly, but your hand should follow a controlled path [Video 3].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Perform the exercise for a set number of repetitions, ensuring you maintain proper form throughout to avoid strain.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always start with lighter resistance to avoid overexertion, especially if you're new to this exercise",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your",

Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff.

The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair. But just lift your heels up off the ground and then slowly come back down. So now",

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

Attach a resistance band or cable at waist height. Ensure you maintain good posture with your shoulders back, head high, and chest up [Video 3: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 10:34-10:40].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Hold the band or cable with your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle, keeping your elbow close to your body. Your forearm should be parallel to the ground [Video 3].\n\n3. **Execution**: Slowly pull the band or cable away from your body, rotating your arm externally. Focus on the quality of the motion, ensuring that your elbow remains stable and close to your side throughout the movement [Video 3].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Perform the exercise in a controlled manner, aiming for 10-15 repetitions. Ensure you maintain proper form to avoid injury.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: Avoid using excessive resistance that compromises your form, as this can lead to strain or injury [Video 3].\n\nThis exercise targets the rotator cuff muscles, enhancing their",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your",

Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair.

Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators.

And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden",

Attach a handle to the cable.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Grasp the handle with the hand closest to the machine. Your elbow should be bent at a 90-degree angle, and your upper arm should be pressed against your side.\n\n3. **Execution**: Keeping your elbow stationary, pull the handle towards your body in a controlled motion, rotating your forearm inward. Ensure that your shoulder remains stable throughout the movement.\n\n4. **Repetition**: Slowly return to the starting position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions. It is important to maintain control and avoid using momentum.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Focus on proper form to prevent shoulder strain. Avoid excessive weight that could compromise your technique, as the rotator cuff muscles are small and can be easily injured if overloaded [Video 2: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 03:53-03:58; Video 3: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 06:15-06:19].\n\nThis exercise",

Try taking a hot shower since the steam of water can help massage your neck and relax your muscles.

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

      "answer": "To relieve a crick in your neck, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Gentle Neck Movements**: Start by slowly rocking your head from side to side. This helps to loosen tight muscles and can alleviate discomfort. Additionally, gently roll your head in a circular motion to work out any knots. Be cautious and stop if you experience any pain during these movements [Video 1: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29].\n\n2. **Stretching**: Incorporate stretching into your routine. For instance, you can pull down with one hand while lifting your head up and across with the other hand. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds before switching sides. This will help to elongate the muscles in your neck and provide relief [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:11-03:13].\n\n3. **Heat and Cold Therapy**: Alternate between applying a cold compress and a heating pad for 20 minutes each. This can help reduce swelling and numb pain, providing further relief [Video 1: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins.

And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this.

      "answer": "If someone is bleeding severely, it is crucial to act quickly to control the bleeding and prevent shock. First, ensure the airway is clear, especially if the bleeding is from the mouth or nose, as this can affect breathing [Video 2: NxO5LvgqZe0, Time: 00:49-00:54]. If there is an object embedded in the wound, do not remove it, as it may be helping to control the bleeding. Instead, apply direct pressure around the object to help close the wound [Video 3: NxO5LvgqZe0, Time: 01:47-01:49]. \n\nIn addition to applying pressure, observe for signs of internal bleeding, such as bruising or a rigid abdomen, which may indicate a more serious condition [Video 1: KMpG4A1-dZ4, Time: 01:27-01:36]. \n\nIn summary, controlling severe bleeding involves ensuring the airway is clear, applying direct pressure to the wound, and being cautious with any embedded objects. If the bleeding is not controlled, the victim may develop shock, which is life-threatening. Immediate medical assistance should be sought.",

You don't have to hold on to anything, but I always say it's best to hold on because then you can focus on your stretches just a little bit more. So with the quad stretch, you really want to get in a good position. I'm going to go ahead and have my timer getting ready to go and I'll just explain as we go along, but it's going to be 30 second stretches, three on each side and we're going to take a little 10 second rest break in between. So I'm going to go ahead and start it and then we'll go along. So with the quad stretch standing, you're just gonna grab your foot and make sure the top part of your leg is straight down.

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

Yeah, even no towel pain with the towel, less pain, more range of motion. But still not all the way, you know, we're looking for full extension. Our end goal is that you can do it without the towel and you have full motion. That's your end goal. However you get there. You might use a mix of of towel and no towel But you can use your hands kind of like this. Your hands sometimes work too. Yeah, little tricks tricks that we'll show you And then we're gonna go on to the last one is just for the rotation now. This was a little tricky It is you can actually rotate right till left and just give a little over pressure on your jaw Always really get lost on these by the way. Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck.

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck. And then, yeah, you can give a little over pressure if you'd like along on the jawline. You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time, but after a couple days or so and sometimes less, if you use a towel, no, this is a tricky part.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

This initial observation is crucial for identifying potential injuries or conditions that may require further attention [Video 2: UrC0lUVWZ00, Time: 03:22-03:26].\n\nKey assessment criteria include:\n1. **Head and Neck**: Inspect for lesions or swelling.\n2. **Chest and Abdomen**: Assess for symmetry and any unusual masses.\n3. **Extremities**: Check for warmth, movement, and any signs of injury or deformity.\n4. **Back**: This area often requires assistance for proper examination, ensuring no abnormalities are overlooked [Video 2].\n\nDuring the assessment, look for warning signs such as significant bruising, swelling, or restricted movement, which may indicate underlying issues that need immediate attention. Always maintain good posture and technique while conducting the assessment to ensure accuracy and comfort for both the examiner and the patient [Video 3: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 10:34-10:40].",

So first of all, what is the rotator cap? The rotator cap is actually a collection of four muscles that serve to stabilize your shoulder joint Now that shoulder joint. It's a ball and socket joint. Here's the socket. Here's the ball It's actually the most mobile joint in the body We have the greatest range of motion available in three different planes of movement in our shoulder joint It's a very mobile joint, but then at the same time it needs to be a very stable joint. That's where that rotator cuff comes in. So again, what you're looking at here, this is my right shoulder blade. Looks just like that with the humorous, the arm bone hanging down right here. You've got four muscles that come off of your shoulder blade. Three of them come from the back, one of them comes from the front. And then you can see that they kind of wrap around the head of that humorous to form a cuff around it. Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade. It needs to be seated in the",

Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal",

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side.

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did.

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

Three of them come from the back, one of them comes from the front. And then you can see that they kind of wrap around the head of that humorous to form a cuff around it. Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade. It needs to be seated in the right location and it needs to stay in that right location throughout movement as we're going through this motion. If it doesn't, that's what can lead to some of the problems that we might experience and some of the pain that you might be experiencing. a lot of times in my experience. If you get pain kind of reaching up an overhead or just with certain shoulder motions in general, oftentimes it's because of that rotator calf. The rotator calf is not strong enough to keep that the ball squarely seated in your socket. Over time, that can lead to pain and pinching and inflammation irritation, even like a rotator calf tear, which we absolutely want to avoid. If we do the right exercises for it, we actually",

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right?

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here.

Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

      "answer": "To stand up with crutches, first ensure you have a stable base. Position the crutches under your arms and place them slightly forward. When transitioning from a seated position to standing, back up until you feel the chair or bed against your unaffected leg. This provides support as you prepare to rise. \n\nNext, lean forward slightly and push down on the armrests or the seat of the chair while simultaneously pressing down on the crutches. This action helps lift your body off the seat. As you rise, keep your weight distributed through the crutches and your unaffected leg. Once standing, adjust your crutches to a comfortable position under your arms for balance. \n\nThis method emphasizes the importance of using your upper body strength to assist in standing while maintaining stability with the crutches. Practicing this technique can enhance your confidence and safety when mobilizing.

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair. But just lift your heels up off the ground and then slowly come back down. So now",

      "answer": "To sit down with crutches, start by positioning yourself correctly in relation to the chair or bed. Back up until you feel the surface behind your unaffected leg. This ensures you are close enough to sit down safely. Once you are in position, bring your crutches forward and maintain your balance. It\u2019s important not to look back to check if the chair is there, as this can lead to losing your balance. Instead, focus on bringing your crutches around to the other side and then lower yourself into the seat in a controlled manner [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 02:46-02:51; 03:30-03:35].\n\nIn summary, the key steps involve backing up to the seat, keeping your crutches forward, and sitting down without looking back. This method promotes stability and reduces the risk of falling while using crutches. Always follow your doctor's advice regarding weight-bearing limitations during this process.",

Place both crutches underneath the opposite side. Reach for the hand railing and you step up with your good leg, so you're going to put weight through both hands, step up with your left foot, and then you bring your crutches up.

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

And if you feel good, you can go full traction like this and just relax if that may take some time. You know what I mean, you just go like this for the first few times. And make sure after you're done with it and you hang for, you know, 10 seconds times three, that will be 30 seconds or after all, it might be 30 seconds straight. After you get up and you walk around and you around, that should continue to feel good. Because once in a while you hang feels good while you're doing it, but you get up and move wrong. And then it hurts. That's not real common, but if it is, then you're going to want to put a caution and very unusual. But I often do these as a preventative thing to sure.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff.

Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal",

Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow.

      "answer": "To properly walk with crutches, ensure that they are fitted correctly and that you are standing tall. Begin by bringing one crutch around to the opposite side of your body while maintaining an upright posture. This technique helps distribute your weight evenly and provides better stability as you move. It is crucial to avoid looking back to check your position, as this can lead to imbalance; instead, focus on your path ahead and control your movements [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 03:30-03:35].\n\nAdditionally, your healthcare provider will inform you about how much weight you can safely place on your injured leg, which is essential for your recovery. Proper technique not only aids in mobility but also helps prevent further injury. \n\nIn summary, walking with crutches involves correct fitting, maintaining an upright posture, and following your doctor's weight-bearing instructions. These practices will enhance your mobility and safety while using crutches.",

Then you're going to bring the crutch around from your unaffected side to your injured side. Bring the crutches out from underneath your armpits, reach down for the hand grips. With the opposite hand, you're going to reach down for the chair or the bed. If you have a chair rest, it will be easier to reach for that. You kick the affected forward and you have a seat. Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this.

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers.

          "text": "In this video, I'm going to show you how to reset forward rounded shoulders with a move that you probably haven't seen before. Stay tuned. Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

If you want to check out some more, make sure you click on the link up there. So with the standing quad stretch. You can pretty much do this anywhere. You don't have to hold on to anything, but I always say it's best to hold on because then you can focus on your stretches just a little bit more. So with the quad stretch, you really want to get in a good position. I'm going to go ahead and have my timer getting ready to go and I'll just explain as we go along, but it's going to be 30 second stretches, three on each side and we're going to take a little 10 second rest break in between. So I'm going to go ahead and start it and then we'll go along. So with the quad stretch standing, you're just gonna grab your foot and make sure the top part of your leg is straight down. So the important part of that stretch is that that quad is down. If it's here, you're not really gonna",

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

This will help you maintain balance as you ascend. \n\nOnce you have a secure grip on the railing, push off with your unaffected leg and step up onto the first step, using the crutch for support. Make sure to bring the crutches up to the next step with you before repeating the process. This method ensures that you maintain stability and control as you navigate the stairs [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 04:23-04:29].\n\nIn summary, when going upstairs with crutches, always prioritize balance and use available handrails for additional support. Move slowly and deliberately to ensure safety throughout the process.",

Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this. Once your crutches are fit correctly and you're standing up, you're going to bring one crutch around to the other side and stand up tall. Your doctor will let you know how much weight you can put through your leg. For this video, I'm demonstrating not putting any weight through my injured leg.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

This is very simple, but you need to know how to do it, because if you do it wrong, you can actually end up hurting yourself. Exactly, so all right. Let's start off with the first thing you want to do is you actually with most of these crutches now They have a little push pin here And there's actually some numbers along here like this for example goes all the way from five one to five nine So it's a good starting point if you're five nine Go ahead and set it up at five nine That's the push the buttons in it's a telescoping needle where and I was like the turret just a little bit and then you can slide that up and down But you gotta get those holes lined up so they click and the button pops out just like that. And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right?

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

If you want to check out some more, make sure you click on the link up there. So with the standing quad stretch. You can pretty much do this anywhere. You don't have to hold on to anything, but I always say it's best to hold on because then you can focus on your stretches just a little bit more. So with the quad stretch, you really want to get in a good position. I'm going to go ahead and have my timer getting ready to go and I'll just explain as we go along, but it's going to be 30 second stretches, three on each side and we're going to take a little 10 second rest break in between. So I'm going to go ahead and start it and then we'll go along. So with the quad stretch standing, you're just gonna grab your foot and make sure the top part of your leg is straight down. So the important part of that stretch is that that quad is down. If it's here, you're not really gonna",

Again, you don't have to pull up as high as I do. I stretch every day, so I'm pretty flexible. So if you can only go to there, that's okay. You just go until you feel uncomfortable, stretch with that. You can also add in a little bit more pushing back to get the hip flexors as well if you want to. So if I'm stretching here and I pull that knee back just a little bit more, I'm gonna get those hip flexors stretching a little bit as well. So if you really wanna get a kind of a combination stretch, you can do that because that's a great area of stretch out if you're sitting up, no falling. If you're sitting a lot throughout the day, because those muscles are in a shortened position. So if you pull it back just a little bit, you're gonna get a combination stretch, which is really good as well. There's a whole bunch of different ways to stretch out your quad, you can do it lying down, you can do it lying on your side, on your stomach. You can use a strap to stretch it out, but if you're at work, and you don't really have equipment, this is the best way to stretch it out.

So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side. That's not a bad thing, but we can make it better if we get the towel and maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter. You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are",

      "answer": "To go downstairs with crutches, begin by positioning yourself close to the staircase. If a railing is available, grasp it for support. First, remove one crutch from the side where you are holding the railing. Place both crutches under your opposite arm, ensuring they are secure. Then, carefully lower your unaffected leg (the leg not injured) down to the first step, followed by the crutches. Finally, bring your injured leg down to the step. This method helps maintain balance and stability while descending stairs [Video 2: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 04:23-04:29].\n\nIn summary, when using crutches to navigate stairs, always prioritize safety by using railings when available and ensuring your crutches are positioned correctly. This technique allows for a smoother descent and minimizes the risk of falls. Remember to take your time and maintain your balance throughout the process.",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get",

Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

Then you're going to bring the crutch around from your unaffected side to your injured side. Bring the crutches out from underneath your armpits, reach down for the hand grips. With the opposite hand, you're going to reach down for the chair or the bed. If you have a chair rest, it will be easier to reach for that. You kick the affected forward and you have a seat. Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this. Once your crutches are fit correctly and you're standing up, you're going to bring one crutch around to the other side and stand up tall. Your doctor will let you know how much weight you can put through your leg. For this video, I'm demonstrating not putting any weight through my injured leg.

My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest. To stretch the forearm muscles for golfers elbow, you're going to exaggerate a very slow wave so that palm of your hand lands on the table top and bench where your fingers point backwards. Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

I'm right-handed here, so I will use my left hand reach over and look down a little bit and hold the upper eyelid so you can see I can barely blink with the right hand. I get a hold of the lower eyelid, and then just slowly move the lens on the eye. And then I close my eyes and just let the lens settle. keep in mind I'm actually doing this face down. So this is the side view of how we insert the lens.

So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down.

That means that it's your back is so tight that it actually does need stretching. So you just work in the range that allows you. And then eventually you might be able to go up this far. If you're still coming off like this, go up to the point where it allows you to go and stop right there and go back down again.

If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out.

So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

Or by taking a couple days, but this one is a good exercise All of us, most of our patients could do this one. Most especially with the stiff back, it's very benign. It's not that hard on the back, right? Yeah. You don't know, I have way bare not, so it's a good one to do. Getting the boom in the back, getting some blood flow with going. 10 to 15 repetitions typically is enough. You can do more if you'd like to. Yeah, okay. Number two, stay right there, Bob. This one can also be done in a bed on a soft surface, or you can do it on the floor. but we're gonna start with single-needed chest and then we're gonna double-need.

You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair.

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

You want to impart it back all the way up the end. While you're doing that, you don't want to hold your back and then your legs. go for a few reps, semi, especially all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, yeah, and relax, relax, relax, that's all, that's all, that's perfect, you want to go for three sets of, you let's say eight to ten, you can try these every and hour or two hours once, yeah, the next move, you're going to go for a single-leg stretch, basically, and lean in the stretch. You can move it forward, you have perfect, and you're trying to maintain your back kind of straight, lean back to the beat, maybe that's cool. Yeah, you don't want to go for a really high stretch, as long as you feel the stretch that you've got. And you can hold that for 10 to 15 seconds, and then you can switch leg, the same routine while you're holding it there, you've been in and out. That's great. Keep it for 10 to 15 seconds, be in and out, and you can try it, it's for let's say for three to four rounds",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

Oh, you want me to use that towel. Yeah. So you can actually have the towel in bed with you and you can just pull up like this and give it a stretch like that. Particularly for some people that are a little older, I'm depending on your body proportions, it's, you know, you need that extra help.

Ensure your legs are straight and relaxed.\n\n2. **Knee Movement**: Keep your ankles together and gently move your knees side to side, mimicking a windshield wiper motion. This should be done slowly and with control. If you experience pain in one direction, avoid that direction and focus on the opposite side instead [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 03:51-03:52].\n\n3. **Leg Raises**: After the side-to-side movement, you can also perform leg raises. Bring both legs up with your knees propped up. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds, allowing blood flow to return to the muscles before slowly lowering your legs back down. Start with 10 repetitions and increase as it becomes easier [Video 2: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 02:06-02:12].\n\n4. **Safety Note**: Always listen to your body. If any movement causes discomfort or pain, stop immediately",

That means that it's your back is so tight that it actually does need stretching. So you just work in the range that allows you. And then eventually you might be able to go up this far. If you're still coming off like this, go up to the point where it allows you to go and stop right there and go back down again.

Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

So then we would go to the towel and And they would take it home, they'd use the towel for a couple of days and they come back. And by then they were almost ready to do it without the towel then. Yeah, even no towel pain with the towel, less pain, more range of motion. But still not all the way, you know, we're looking for full extension.

Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

So there's a lot of different ways you can do this, but I like this one where you're basically arch up the middle back, but I like to bring the head down to the same time. Stretching all the muscles. This gets from the low back even in the thoracic, and then going up, I bring my head up to the other direction, and I arched the back to the other direction. Yeah, I hollow out the back and right in here. I've got to admit, Bob, these 60 years old, and there are not a lot of 60-year-old people who have a back as flexible as he",

You can move it forward, you have perfect, and you're trying to maintain your back kind of straight, lean back to the beat, maybe that's cool.

So then we would go to the towel and And they would take it home, they'd use the towel for a couple of days and they come back. And by then they were almost ready to do it without the towel then. Yeah, even no towel pain with the towel, less pain, more range of motion. But still not all the way, you know, we're looking for full extension.

Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand.

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out.

Place your hands shoulder-width apart and gently push your upper body off the ground while keeping your lower body relaxed. If this is too challenging, you can start by propping yourself up on your elbows to ease into the stretch [Video 3: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 06:19-06:25].\n\n3. **Cat-Camel Stretch**: Transition into the cat-camel stretch. While on all fours, alternate between arching your back upward (cat position) and lowering it down (camel position). This movement helps to mobilize the spine and relieve tension in the lower back [Video 2: 0w1GlJTH2x4, Time: 00:49-00:56].\n\n4. **Safety Note**: Ensure",

So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all. So again, holding that for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side, if you've got just some general next stiffness, and you",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

So there's a lot of different ways you can do this, but I like this one where you're basically arch up the middle back, but I like to bring the head down to the same time. Stretching all the muscles. This gets from the low back even in the thoracic, and then going up, I bring my head up to the other direction, and I arched the back to the other direction. Yeah, I hollow out the back and right in here. I've got to admit, Bob, these 60 years old, and there are not a lot of 60-year-old people who have a back as flexible as he",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all.

So then we would go to the towel and And they would take it home, they'd use the towel for a couple of days and they come back. And by then they were almost ready to do it without the towel then. Yeah, even no towel pain with the towel, less pain, more range of motion. But still not all the way, you know, we're looking for full extension.

Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow.

To stretch the wrist flexors, find a table or bench that plays the palm of your hand on top of the table and lean and body weight on them. This should create a slight stretch already. If you still don't feel the stretch, slightly lean forward with your body weight until you feel a slight stretch, the back of your wrist or in the inner portion of your forearm. Now if you don't feel any pain or severe pain, you are now ready to lean side to side. Nice and slow. This will mobilize the wrist and wrist extension and also stretch out the wrist flex muscle. To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm.

That means that it's your back is so tight that it actually does need stretching. So you just work in the range that allows you. And then eventually you might be able to go up this far.

      "answer": "To arch backwards for lower back pain relief, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Find a sturdy surface or backrest that allows you to lean back comfortably. This could be a chair or a wall that supports your back while you perform the movement [Video 3: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 05:40-05:46].\n\n2. **Initial Movement**: Start by gently leaning back into the support, allowing your back to arch. Pay attention to your body; this movement should not cause sharp pain. If you experience discomfort, particularly sharp pain, skip this step [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 06:50-06:52].\n\n3. **Repetitions**: Perform this arching motion in a controlled manner. Begin with a few repetitions and assess how your body responds. If you feel a slight discomfort initially, it may improve with continued practice. However, if the discomfort persists or worsens, stop the exercise [Video 1].\n\n4. **Safety Note**: Always listen to your body. If any movement causes significant pain, it is crucial to stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional for advice tailored to your specific",

To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest. To stretch the forearm muscles for golfers elbow, you're going to exaggerate a very slow wave so that palm of your hand lands on the table top and bench where your fingers point backwards. Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay?

You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level. Once you hit that, this is going to be the next part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch, and I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds, I'm going to then relax, and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next",

Then you're going to grab the other hand, make sure you're not choking yourself, but bring it up up and over your ear. So this time you're gonna kind of pull up and over. So you're not just pulling a cross. That's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull. So I'm pulling down with this hand and up and across with this hand. So I'm getting a nice, good stretch in there. And so this one sends us a full stretch. I'm gonna hold it for 30 seconds.

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can",

      "answer": "To stretch the lower back while hanging, you can follow these steps based on the provided video evidence:\n\n1. **Find a Suitable Bar**: Use a sturdy pull-up bar or similar structure that can support your weight. Ensure it is high enough for you to hang freely without touching the ground.\n\n2. **Hang with a Grip**: Grasp the bar with both hands, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Allow your body to hang down, keeping your arms straight. This position helps decompress the spine.\n\n3. **Engage Your Core**: While hanging, engage your core muscles to maintain stability. This helps protect your lower back from strain.\n\n4. **Incorporate Leg Movements**: You can perform leg movements to enhance the stretch. For instance, try crossing one leg over the other while maintaining a straight back. This can help stretch the hips and lower back simultaneously [Video 1: 0w1GlJTH2x4, Time: 02:03-02:08].\n\n5. **Hold the Position**: Maintain the hanging position for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply to relax your back muscles.\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid swinging or jerking movements while hanging, as this can lead",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention.

This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event.

And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

This allows the blood gas levels to stabilize [Video 1].\n\n3. **Prepare the Equipment**: Use a blood gas syringe, which fills automatically to an average of two milliliters. Ensure that the syringe is functioning properly before use [Video 2: 71LlfdW548U, Time: 03:32-03:37].\n\n4. **Access the Arterial Line**: If you do not see blood when attempting to draw, you may have missed the artery. In this case, withdraw the needle slightly and realign it towards the pulsating artery [Video 2].\n\n5. **Stabilize the Patient's Arm**: Instruct the patient to keep their arm and wrist still to prevent dislodging the needle",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip. If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring loaded land set that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the bone so it releases the land set to pump your skin for the blood sample. So often as",

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe but are now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. TIP FIVE! That's it. A yellow shark's been an out-one or two-ing diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips. How can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood",

Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this.

It's advisable to use only one meter consistently to track your glucose levels accurately over time [Video 1: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 04:23-04:28].\n\n2. **Prepare Your Finger**: Warm your hands to facilitate blood flow, making it easier to obtain a sample. This can be done by rubbing your hands together or running them under warm water [Video 2: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 03:41-03:44].\n\n3. **Use the Lancet Device**: Place the lancet device firmly against the side of your fingertip. Press the release button to puncture the skin. After the puncture, remove the device from your finger [Video 2: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 03:41-03:44].\n\n4. **Obtain a Blood Sample**: If necessary, apply very light pressure around the puncture site to encourage a drop of blood to form.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event.

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood.

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

This can make it easier to obtain a sufficient blood drop without excessive pressure [Video 1: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 03:41-03:44].\n\n2. **Use a Lancet Device**: Firmly place the lancet device on the side of your finger. Press the release button to puncture the skin. After the puncture, carefully remove the device from the finger [Video 1].\n\n3. **Obtain a Blood Drop**: If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area of the puncture site to encourage a blood drop to form. Avoid applying too much pressure, as this can affect the quality of the blood sample [Video 1].\n\n4. **Apply Blood to the Testing Strip**: Once a sufficient blood drop has formed, bring the testing strip to the drop and allow the strip to absorb the blood. Ensure that the blood fills the designated area on the strip as per the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: Always dispose of the lancet and any used materials safely to prevent injury or",

Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt.

      "answer": "To use a peak flow meter, start by standing up straight and holding the meter correctly. The indicator should be at the bottom when you place it in your mouth. This ensures that you get an accurate reading when you blow into the device. It is designed to be user-friendly, allowing even children as young as four to perform the test effectively [Video 1: RRLY6anXXQo, Time: 00:27-00:33].\n\nOnce you have the meter positioned properly, take a deep breath, seal your lips around the mouthpiece, and blow out as hard and fast as you can. The peak flow meter will measure how quickly you can exhale air, which is important for monitoring conditions like asthma. After taking the reading, check where the indicator has moved to determine your peak expiratory flow rate.\n\nIn summary, using a peak flow meter involves standing straight, positioning the device correctly, and blowing forcefully into it. This simple process is crucial for tracking respiratory health, especially for individuals with asthma or other lung conditions.",

          "text": "In some cases, there is no obvious external bleeding, but still the victim is serious. How do we manage this? Good observation. Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

If you don't have a dressing, ask the causality to apply direct pressure themselves to stop the bleeding. Jenny, can you pay for some pressure for me, please? Brilliant, excellent, no done. Ask a helper to call 999 or 124 emergency help. Or if you're on your own, use a mobile on speakerphone, so you can keep treating the casualty. Tell the emergency surfaces where the bleeding is coming from and the amount of bleeding. The casualty may leave up shop. So help them to lie down on a blanket or a rug. If there's one to protect them from the coal, we're using support their legs so they are above the level of their heart. Do not wear the leg if it is injured. Can I get a leg down? Thanks.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin.

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins.

If a recent change in ventilator setting has been made, wait approximately 20 to 30 minutes before sampling. that the arterial line is functioning properly. Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure. Place the syringe onto the ice, pack ice cubes over the syringe, and send it off to the lab right away, arterial blood gas or ABG samples should be analyzed within 10 minutes of collection for accurate results. Discard all sharps, such as used needles, syringes, and potential sharps like glass items into a puncture resistant sharps-waste container.

Ask a helper to call 999 or 124 emergency help. Or if you're on your own, use a mobile on speakerphone, so you can keep treating the casualty. Tell the emergency surfaces where the bleeding is coming from and the amount of bleeding. The casualty may leave up shop. So help them to lie down on a blanket or a rug. If there's one to protect them from the coal, we're using support their legs so they are above the level of their heart. Do not wear the leg if it is injured. Can I get a leg down? Thanks. It's going to lift the legs up, is it okay? Secure the dress here with a bandage that is firm enough to maintain the pressure, but doesn't cut off the circulation.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin.

          "text": "Hey everybody, it's Dr. Joe. Today, I'm going to show you some exercises to help with vericose fanes. Let's get started. Disclaimer work. Disclaimer work. So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze.

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins.

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

Signs of internal bleeding can manifest as bruises or contusions on the skin, a painful and rigid abdomen, or the presence of blood in vomit or stools [Video 1: KMpG4A1-dZ4, Time: 01:27-01:36]. \n\nIn cases where shock is suspected, especially due to uncontrolled bleeding, it is essential to ensure that the airway is clear, as compromised breathing can exacerbate the situation [Video 2: NxO5LvgqZe0, Time: 00:49-00:54]. Immediate action may involve calling emergency services to provide professional medical assistance.\n\nIn summary, recognizing the signs of shock and potential internal bleeding is vital for effective management. Ensuring airway patency and seeking emergency help are critical steps in addressing the condition promptly. The provided video evidence emphasizes the importance of these actions in managing shock effectively.",

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

Here's the socket. Here's the ball It's actually the most mobile joint in the body We have the greatest range of motion available in three different planes of movement in our shoulder joint It's a very mobile joint, but then at the same time it needs to be a very stable joint. That's where that rotator cuff comes in. So again, what you're looking at here, this is my right shoulder blade. Looks just like that with the humorous, the arm bone hanging down right here. You've got four muscles that come off of your shoulder blade. Three of them come from the back, one of them comes from the front. And then you can see that they kind of wrap around the head of that humorous to form a cuff around it. Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal",

We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

The top of the crutch should be about 1-2 inches below your armpit when standing straight, and the handgrips should be at the level of your wrist when your arms are relaxed at your sides. This positioning allows for optimal support and comfort while using the crutches.\n\nWhile the provided video evidence does not specifically detail the adjustment process for crutches, it does emphasize the importance of maintaining good posture and positioning during physical activities. For instance, it mentions keeping shoulders back and head high, which is crucial when using crutches to avoid strain and ensure balance [Video 2: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 10:34-10:40]. \n\nIn summary, while the videos do not provide explicit instructions on adjusting crutches, they highlight the significance of proper posture, which is vital for effective crutch use. For specific adjustments, refer to a healthcare provider or a physical therapist for personalized guidance.",

So first of all, what is the rotator cap? The rotator cap is actually a collection of four muscles that serve to stabilize your shoulder joint Now that shoulder joint. It's a ball and socket joint. Here's the socket. Here's the ball It's actually the most mobile joint in the body We have the greatest range of motion available in three different planes of movement in our shoulder joint It's a very mobile joint, but then at the same time it needs to be a very stable joint. That's where that rotator cuff comes in. So again, what you're looking at here, this is my right shoulder blade. Looks just like that with the humorous, the arm bone hanging down right here. You've got four muscles that come off of your shoulder blade. Three of them come from the back, one of them comes from the front. And then you can see that they kind of wrap around the head of that humorous to form a cuff around it. Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade. It needs to be seated in the",

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right, and I'm going to bend it because what we're going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw backwards. So this is the first part. I'm going to take my right hand, I'm going to place on the opposite side of the door frame and I'm going to pull into my body weight, I should say, into the door frame. You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level. Once you hit that, this is going to be the next part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch, and I'm telling you right",

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood.

You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

It's going to lift the legs up, is it okay? Secure the dress here with a bandage that is firm enough to maintain the pressure, but doesn't cut off the circulation. So, this is going to apply this dressing to the key, okay, okay,",

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

So there's a lot of different ways you can do this, but I like this one where you're basically arch up the middle back, but I like to bring the head down to the same time. Stretching all the muscles. This gets from the low back even in the thoracic, and then going up, I bring my head up to the other direction, and I arched the back to the other direction.

You can move it forward, you have perfect, and you're trying to maintain your back kind of straight, lean back to the beat, maybe that's cool.

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

Ensure your wrists are aligned under your shoulders and your knees under your hips.\n\n2. **Cat Position**: Inhale deeply and arch your back upward, tucking your chin towards your chest. This position is often referred to as the \"cat\" position. Hold this posture for a moment to feel the stretch in your back.\n\n3. **Camel Position**: Exhale and slowly drop your belly towards the floor while lifting your head and tailbone upwards, creating a gentle arch in your back. This is known as the \"camel\" position. \n\n4. **Repetition**: Alternate between these two positions, moving smoothly and gently. Aim for several repetitions, ensuring you do not experience sharp pain during the exercise. If you feel discomfort, it is advised to skip that movement [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 06:50-06:52].\n\n5. **Duration**: Perform this exercise for a few minutes, gradually increasing the repetitions as your comfort level improves [Video 2: 0w1Gl",

Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade.

If you get pain kind of reaching up an overhead or just with certain shoulder motions in general, oftentimes it's because of that rotator calf. The rotator calf is not strong enough to keep that the ball squarely seated in your socket.

This is the one I go back to again, again, because it definitely when I'm starting to have some pain, that's the one that takes time. Sure. Sure.

It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again.

Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture.

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

This was a little tricky It is you can actually rotate right till left and just give a little over pressure on your jaw Always really get lost on these by the way. Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck. And then, yeah, you can give a little over pressure if you'd like along on the jawline. You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time, but after a couple days or so and sometimes less, if you use a towel, no, this is a tricky part. Yeah, I'm going to rotate to the right, so I'm going to take my right hand, grab the left tail of the towel, that's on the left shoulder. Up over the jaw and rotate, that's my bump",

Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on.

Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it.

Do this 20 to 30 reps on each direction and also repeat it three to four sets, owner and radial distractions. Grab the end of the wrist with the other hand and slightly pull the wrist joint apart. This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury. Or another one, such as a couple tunnels in drone, passive, risk flexion and extension. To stretch through risk flexors, point your fingers up in your elbows, extend it nice and straight. Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors. Make sure your arm is nice and straight and your elbow is locked out. This is a great way to mobilize and",

It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand.

My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

Now if you're finding that you're losing a lot of grip strength from for example sports For example, golf or even tennis, these stretches and mobilization techniques are going to help you regain that grip strength once again, and even alleviate the pain that you might be getting from golf as elbow or tennis elbow. Try these stretches out, they're definitely going to help you. waves. Interlace your fingers and create a wave back and forth with the wrist and hands.

I'm right-handed here, so I will use my left hand reach over and look down a little bit and hold the upper eyelid so you can see I can barely blink with the right hand. I get a hold of the lower eyelid, and then just slowly move the lens on the eye. And then I close my eyes and just let the lens settle. keep in mind I'm actually doing this face down. So this is the side view of how we insert the lens. Again just reaching over, grabbing the top eyelid and the lower eyelid slowly move the lens onto the eye, watching the eye that you're working with, keep closed and just let the lens settle.

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip. If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring loaded land set that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the bone so it releases the land set to pump your skin for the blood sample. So often as",

If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure.

Discard all sharps, such as used needles, syringes, and potential sharps like glass items into a puncture resistant sharps-waste container.

      "answer": "To prepare for wearing ortho-k lenses, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Gather Supplies**: Start by collecting your ortho-k lenses and a suitable lens solution. It's essential to have a clean environment to minimize the risk of contamination.\n\n2. **Prepare the Lens**: Place one or two drops of the lens solution into the lens bowl. This helps to ensure the lens is adequately lubricated for insertion [Video 1: GZsHRoAXj3Y, Time: 01:53-02:00].\n\n3. **Insert the Lens**: Carefully move the lens onto your fingertip, ensuring it is facing down. Position your finger with the lens above your eye, and gently insert the lens into your eye. \n\n4. **Let it Settle**: After insertion, allow the lens to settle in your eye. This is crucial for comfort and proper positioning.\n\n5. **Eyelid Technique**: Pay attention to how you fold your eyelids during the insertion process, as this can affect the ease of lens placement and comfort.\n\nAlways ensure your hands are clean before handling the lenses to prevent infections. Proper hygiene is vital when dealing with contact lenses. \n\nFor more detailed visual guidance, refer to the",

Make sure I put one or two drops into the lens bowl and just carefully move the lens back on the finger tip here and then facing down I will insert the lens. Okay that's it let it settle so now I'm just going to show you a close-up of what happens with the eyelids, how we fold the eyelids when we are inserting the off of the lens. I'm right-handed here, so I will use my left hand reach over and look down a little bit and hold the upper eyelid so you can see I can barely blink with the right hand. I get a hold of the lower eyelid, and then just slowly move the lens on the eye. And then I close my eyes and just let the lens settle. keep in mind I'm actually doing this face down. So this is the side view of how we insert the lens. Again just reaching over, grabbing the top eyelid and the lower eyelid slowly move the lens onto the eye, watching the eye that you're working with, keep closed and just let the lens settle.

Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip. If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring loaded land set that we fitted earlier.

A pig flow meter is easy to use, even children as young as four should be able to perform a pig flow with good results. Let's take a look at how it's done. Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure. Place the syringe onto the ice, pack ice cubes over the syringe, and send it off to the lab right away, arterial blood gas or ABG samples should be analyzed within 10 minutes of collection for accurate results. Discard all sharps, such as used needles, syringes, and potential sharps like glass items into a puncture resistant sharps-waste container. Place other items like used gloves and all items contaminated with blood or body fluids into the infectious waste bag. Recheck labels and requisition forms for accuracy. Perform hand hygiene. Monitor the site and extremity for a while for any sign of circulatory problems, nerve damage, or any other complications. To practice drawing arterial blood with the venapukshar trainer,",

This helps to ensure proper hydration and comfort when inserting the lens [Video 1: GZsHRoAXj3Y, Time: 01:53-02:00].\n\n2. **Position the Lens**: Carefully move the lens onto your fingertip, ensuring it is facing down. This positioning is crucial for a successful insertion.\n\n3. **Insert the Lens**: With the lens on your fingertip, gently insert it into your eye. It\u2019s important to let the lens settle in place once inserted. \n\n4. **Eyelid Management**: While inserting the lens, you may need to fold your eyelids appropriately to facilitate the process. This technique can help in aligning the lens correctly on the cornea.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always ensure your hands are clean before handling the lenses to prevent infections. If you experience discomfort or vision issues after insertion, consult your eye care professional.\n\nFollowing these steps will help you wear ortho-k lenses safely and effectively.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin.

Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon.

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins.

This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury.

Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors. Make sure your arm is nice and straight and your elbow is locked out. This is a great way to mobilize and",

And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few",

Try taking a hot shower since the steam of water can help massage your neck and relax your muscles.

My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this.

It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front.

      "answer": "To treat a crick in the neck using neck side bends, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Gentle Side Bends**: Start by slowly rocking your head from side to side. This movement can help relieve tension and work out any knots in the neck. Ensure that you perform this motion gently to avoid exacerbating any discomfort. If you experience pain during this exercise, stop immediately [Video 1: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29].\n\n2. **Circular Movements**: In addition to side bends, gently roll your head around in a circular motion. This can further help in loosening tight muscles and improving mobility in the neck.\n\n3. **Heat and Cold Therapy**: Alternate between applying a cold compress and a heating pad to the affected area for 20 minutes each. The cold compress can help reduce swelling and numb pain, while the heating pad can relax tight muscles [Video 1: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29].\n\n4. **Hot Shower**: Taking a hot shower can also be beneficial as the steam and warmth may help relax the neck muscles [Video ",

Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on",

Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this. Once your crutches are fit correctly and you're standing up, you're going to bring one crutch around to the other side and stand up tall. Your doctor will let you know how much weight you can put through your leg. For this video, I'm demonstrating not putting any weight through my injured leg.

Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side. That's not a bad thing, but we can make it better if we get the towel and maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter. You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did.

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

This was a little tricky It is you can actually rotate right till left and just give a little over pressure on your jaw Always really get lost on these by the way. Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck. And then, yeah, you can give a little over pressure if you'd like along on the jawline. You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time, but after a couple days or so and sometimes less, if you use a towel, no, this is a tricky part. Yeah, I'm going to rotate to the right, so I'm going to take my right hand, grab the left tail of the towel, that's on the left shoulder. Up over the jaw and rotate, that's my bump",

Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on",

Use a towel roll for support at the base of your neck, not higher up. This provides stability during the exercises [Video 1: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 05:01-05:07].\n\n2. **Perform Chin Tucks**: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest while maintaining the towel support. This helps to engage the neck muscles without straining them.\n\n3. **Isometric Exercises**: Apply gentle pressure against your hand placed on your forehead or the side of your head. Hold this position for a few seconds, then release. Repeat this for each side of your neck to strengthen the muscles [Video 1: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n4. **Monitor Pain Levels**: If any movement causes increased pain, stop immediately. Focus on movements that do not exacerbate discomfort. It's important to \"go the pain freeway,\" meaning you should avoid directions that cause pain [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time",

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow.

My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee.

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture.

      "answer": "To determine if you have tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis, start by assessing the location of your pain. Typically, the pain is felt on the outer part of the elbow, with possible extension down into the forearm. You may also experience tightness in the surrounding muscles [Video 1: Mtd0U13cfx0, Time: 00:46-00:50].\n\nNext, consider how the pain began. Tennis elbow often develops gradually due to repetitive motion or overuse, particularly in activities that involve gripping or twisting motions. If your pain started suddenly, it may indicate a different issue.\n\nIt's also important to evaluate any accompanying symptoms, such as weakness in the forearm or difficulty with gripping objects. If you experience significant pain or functional limitations, it\u2019s advisable to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and tailored treatment plan.\n\nRemember to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain during your assessment, as this could worsen your condition. If you suspect tennis elbow, rest and ice may help alleviate symptoms while you seek further advice [Video 1].",

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting. Move side to side for about 20 to 30 reps and repeat it for the five times. Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow stretch. To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards.

Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair.

While waiting for help to arrive, keep them comfortable, supported and reassure them. To not give them anything to eat or drink, because it may be hard for them to swallow.

Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

      "answer": "To check for tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis using a chair, you can perform a simple test involving wrist extension. Here\u2019s a step-by-step procedure:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit on a chair with your forearm resting on a table or your thigh, ensuring your elbow is straight and locked out. This position stabilizes your arm for the test.\n\n2. **Hand Placement**: Place the back of your hand on the table or bench, with your wrist in a neutral position. This helps in isolating the wrist extensors, which are often affected in tennis elbow.\n\n3. **Leaning Back**: Gently lean your body weight backward while keeping your elbow straight. You should feel a stretch at the back of your hand or wrist. This action tests the flexibility and strength of the wrist extensors, which can indicate issues if pain is present during the stretch [Video 1: hJ3XICFLxvU, Time: 03:58-04:03].\n\n4. **Safety Note**: Ensure that the stretch is comfortable and does not cause severe pain. If you experience significant discomfort, stop the test immediately.\n\nThis method provides a preliminary assessment of potential lateral epicondylitis symptoms",

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Do this 20 to 30 reps on each direction and also repeat it three to four sets, owner and radial distractions. Grab the end of the wrist with the other hand and slightly pull the wrist joint apart. This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury. Or another one, such as a couple tunnels in drone, passive, risk flexion and extension. To stretch through risk flexors, point your fingers up in your elbows, extend it nice and straight. Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors.

This one goes almost across the eyelids and I'm trying to keep this shoulder from turning. So this left shoulder I'm keeping it back. I'm not going like this along with the neck. Sometimes they even hook it around the chair. Sure. Yeah, that locks it in. It's It's amazing what this technique does. The support around your low neck, and the... Then it'll kill his and my bump into the... And a little bit, yeah, so I'm going to cheat a little bit here. I'll go back to this way. But that wrap around the neck",

This was a little tricky It is you can actually rotate right till left and just give a little over pressure on your jaw Always really get lost on these by the way. Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck. And then, yeah, you can give a little over pressure if you'd like along on the jawline. You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time, but after a couple days or so and sometimes less, if you use a towel, no, this is a tricky part.

Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully.

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

We have the patient go like this with their strong leg, put a little passive range. We always find that people get better range when they do the pressure versus the therapist going on their question. She's shoving it in the right. Because they're not in control. then people don't feel comfortable and somebody else is in control of a painful joint. Mike, you got some more comments on that aspect of the knee glide? Yeah, flat is okay to do. I feel like when I get here, it gets tied on my ankles. I just have tight ankles because I've sprained them both, but just having that little bit of an incline really helps be able to bring it back there without having that ankle issues. So. And then going uphill direction does put a little more emphasis on quad strength. So that's another benefit. The other really nice thing about it is you can use this for pre-hab. So before surgery, we have some surgeons and people that will use it prior. So they get used to the equipment, it get that knee moving. And to be honest with you, people say, I use this more.

There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing range of motion after surgery. Oftentimes, it's a very next day. You've got to get that joint moving. There will be maybe some instances where that's not the case, but total need is almost always. And this works great. Your knee hurts at sore, but you got to get it moving. and you get it going and on the flat. Now, Mike has his at an angle where he's gonna emphasize the hamstring strength. This might not be early on, this would be more for strength and then later on down the river. Maybe a couple of weeks, three weeks down the road. As you can do it this way, we find that when you put it on an incline, this direction works really well right after that,",

My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair. But just lift your heels up off the ground and then slowly come back down. So now",

      "answer": "To use a knee glide effectively for regaining motion after knee surgery, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Ensure you have a knee glide device. This device is beneficial as it works well on flat surfaces and does not require a towel, which can hinder movement on carpeting [Video 2].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Sit comfortably with your knee positioned on the knee glide. Make sure the glide is stable and on a flat surface to facilitate smooth movement.\n\n3. **Movement**: Begin by using your strong leg to assist in moving the knee glide back and forth. This passive range of motion can help in easing stiffness and promoting mobility in the affected knee [Video 1: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 03:34-03:35].\n\n4. **Incline Use**: If you experience difficulty, consider using the knee glide on an incline. This can change the angle of the ankle joint and may improve the effectiveness of the glide [Video 1: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 03:34-03:35].\n\n5. **Frequency**: Incorporate this exercise into your daily routine as advised by your healthcare provider, ensuring you do not overexert",

          "text": "okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing range of motion after surgery. Oftentimes, it's a very next day. You've got to get that joint moving. There will be maybe some instances where that's not the case, but total need is almost always. And this works great. Your knee hurts at sore, but you got to get it moving. and you get it going and on the flat. Now, Mike has his at an angle where he's gonna emphasize the hamstring strength. This might not be early on, this would be more for strength and then later on down the river. Maybe a couple of weeks, three weeks down the road. As you can do it this way, we find that when you put it on an incline, this direction works really well right after that,",

So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax.

I stretch every day, so I'm pretty flexible. So if you can only go to there, that's okay. You just go until you feel uncomfortable, stretch with that.

So you're not just pulling a cross. That's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull. So I'm pulling down with this hand and up and across with this hand. So I'm getting a nice, good stretch in there. And so this one sends us a full stretch. I'm gonna hold it for 30 seconds. And then after that 30 seconds, if you wanna switch sides, You can, so now I'm holding it with this one right over here and then grabbing this one and coming up and over. So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one.

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",
