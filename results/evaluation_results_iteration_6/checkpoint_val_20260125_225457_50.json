          "text": "I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for part few health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the blade. Stop the blade is very simple. Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Ensure you are wearing gloves or using a barrier to protect yourself from blood exposure.\n\n2. **Apply Direct Pressure**: The first step in controlling bleeding is to apply direct pressure to the wound. Use a clean cloth, bandage, or your hand to firmly press down on the wound. This helps to slow down or stop the bleeding by compressing the blood vessels [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38].\n\n3. **Maintain Pressure**: Keep the pressure constant and do not lift the cloth or bandage to check the bleeding frequently, as this can disrupt any clotting that may be occurring.\n\n4. **Wound Packing**: If the bleeding does not stop with direct pressure, the next step is wound packing, which involves placing sterile gauze into the wound to absorb blood and maintain pressure.\n\n5. **Consider a Tourniquet**: If bleeding is severe and does not respond to pressure or packing,",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

      "answer": "To properly pack gauze inside a wound, follow these steps as outlined by Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery.\n\n1. **Apply Pressure**: The first step is to apply direct pressure to the wound to control bleeding. This is crucial before any packing occurs, as it helps to minimize blood loss and stabilize the patient [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38].\n\n2. **Wound Packing**: After applying pressure, you can begin to pack the gauze into the wound. Use sterile gauze and gently push it into the wound to fill the space. Ensure that the gauze is packed tightly enough to control bleeding but not so tightly that it causes additional damage to the tissue.\n\n3. **Apply a Tourniquet if Necessary**: If bleeding continues despite packing, a tourniquet may be required as a last resort. This should only be done if the bleeding is severe and cannot be controlled by other means [Video 1].\n\n**Safety Considerations**: Always wear gloves when handling wounds to prevent infection. Ensure that the gauze is sterile to reduce the risk of introducing bacteria into the wound.",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video.

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms hang down, the wrists should come up even with the handles here. Right, so if they're like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well. And these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other right. But first, how do we make sure that the height is right down there? That's good point. Let's make sure",

Yes, which you're going to find out how useful this can be for after surgery as well as before surgery. So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation and the strength in your arms so that when you put your hands on the crutches you do have a slight bend in your elbow and a slight gap underneath your armpits of about two finger widths. You're going to put your affected extremity or leg forward. Both crutches will be on the side of the injured leg. You're going to push up from the hand grips with one hand in the chair or the bed with the opposite hand. So you're going to lean forward, push up with both arms. Once you have your balance, you bring one crutch around to the opposite side and place both crutches beneath your armpits. And you can see that I am using the surface behind me, the chair, a little",

          "text": "I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for part few health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the blade. Stop the blade is very simple. Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

If you don't see blood, you have missed the artery and will have to withdraw the needle somewhat and then re-aign the syringe toward the pulsating artery.

If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure. Place the syringe onto the ice, pack ice cubes over the syringe, and send it off to the lab right away, arterial blood gas or ABG samples should be analyzed within 10 minutes of collection for accurate results.

Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove.

This helps to control bleeding and stabilize the area before further intervention is taken. \n\n2. **Wound Packing**: After applying pressure, the next step is wound packing. This involves using a clean, absorbent material to fill the wound cavity. Ensure that the packing material is placed directly into the wound to absorb blood and help control the bleeding. It is crucial to avoid packing too tightly, as this may impede circulation to the area.\n\n3. **Tourniquet Application**: If bleeding continues despite packing, the final step is to apply a tourniquet above the wound site. This should only be done if direct pressure and packing do not stop the bleeding, as it can restrict blood flow to the extremity.\n\nAlways ensure to wear gloves and use sterile materials to minimize the risk of infection during the process [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38].",

So let's set up nice and tall, whether you're work at home, in a chair, nice and tall. Let's bring the fingertips to the shoulders as best you can. Take a breath. And as you exhale, start rolling forward so that you're drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Just notice that soreness, gosh, wow, we carry so much in that region, don't we? let's take it now to the rear. And so to the front and to the back you do it maybe about 30 to 45 seconds. Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully. And again, inhale up, exhale it down, just one more, inhale up, exhale it out. Just notice very quickly the body responds, so quick and effective ways just to get rid of that tension and stress on the shoulders.",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

      "answer": "To relieve shoulder stress in just 60 seconds, follow these simple steps:\n\n1. **Posture Setup**: Begin by sitting or standing tall. Ensure your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed. This position is crucial for effective stretching and tension release [Video 1: CvW-Zq3NlkU, Time: 00:27-00:33].\n\n2. **Fingertip Placement**: Bring your fingertips to your shoulders. This will help you engage your shoulder muscles effectively during the exercise.\n\n3. **Breathing**: Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs completely. This helps prepare your body for the movement and promotes relaxation.\n\n4. **Exhale and Roll**: As you exhale, start rolling your shoulders forward. Imagine you are drawing invisible circles with your shoulders. This motion should be smooth and controlled, allowing your muscles to stretch and release tension.\n\n5. **Duration**: Continue this rolling motion for about 60 seconds, focusing on the sensation of relief in your shoulders.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you are not straining your neck or back during this exercise. If you feel any discomfort, stop immediately and reassess your posture [Video 1].",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity",

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few",

So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for",

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use",

If they are cold or have clammy extremities, this can make finding veins more challenging.\n\n2. **Warm the Extremities**: Use a warm compress or have the patient rub their hands together to increase blood flow to the veins. This is crucial for patients with poor circulation.\n\n3. **Apply a Tourniquet**: Place a tourniquet above the intended injection site to engorge the veins. Make sure it is not too tight to avoid discomfort or complications.\n\n4. **Use Gravity**: Position the arm downward to help fill the veins with blood. This can assist in making the veins more prominent.\n\n5. **Palpate the Vein**: Gently palpate the area to locate a suitable vein. Look for a vein that feels firm and bouncy.\n\n6. **Safety Considerations**: Always ensure that the area is clean and that you are using proper aseptic techniques to prevent infection [Video 1: 7lGE4OH0u",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity",

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we",

On the start of your operating day in the morning, your first patient is in the operating room eight and it comes with the 10 to 15 minutes delay. As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands or I should say your arms. And you're going to, again, put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame. Just like this. Put your feet together. And then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. So with this, it should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those peck muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region. Those are the rhomboids where the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by",

And as you exhale, start rolling forward so that you're drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Just notice that soreness, gosh, wow, we carry so much in that region, don't we? let's take it now to the rear. And so to the front and to the back you do it maybe about 30 to 45 seconds. Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully.

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

      "answer": "To reset forward rounded shoulders using a towel and a doorframe, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Towel**: Take a towel and roll it up tightly. This will serve as a support for your upper back.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Stand in a doorway. Place the rolled towel horizontally between your shoulder blades, ensuring it is positioned at the upper back area. This will help open up your chest and counteract the forward rounding of your shoulders.\n\n3. **Doorframe Stretch**: Place your arms on the doorframe at shoulder height, with your elbows bent at 90 degrees. Step forward gently until you feel a stretch across your chest and shoulders. This position helps to realign your shoulders and stretch the tight muscles in your chest.\n\n4. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this stretch for about 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply to relax your muscles.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: Ensure that you do not overstretch or feel pain during this exercise. If discomfort arises, ease back and adjust your position [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 00:55-01:01]. \n\nThis method effectively helps in correcting rounded shoulders by promoting better posture.",

Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands or I should say your arms. And you're going to, again, put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame. Just like this. Put your feet together. And then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. So with this, it should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those peck muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region. Those are the rhomboids where the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by",

I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds, I'm going to then relax, and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

Once you hit that, this is going to be the next part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch, and I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds, I'm going to then relax, and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next part, we're going to focus on two big instigators of rounded shoulders that is tight chest or peck muscles and also the rhomboids. So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame.

This exercise does not require any special equipment, making it accessible for most individuals [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 01:08-01:13].\n\n2. **Position Your Arms**: Place your arms on the doorframe at about shoulder height or slightly above. Ensure your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.\n\n3. **Lean Forward**: Gently lean your body weight into the doorframe. This action will help stretch the chest muscles and encourage your shoulders to move back into a more neutral position [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 00:55-01:01].\n\n4. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply to help relax the muscles. You should feel a stretch across your chest and shoulders.\n\n5. **Repeat as Needed**: You can perform this stretch multiple times throughout the day to help alleviate tension and improve posture.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience any pain or discomfort while performing this exercise",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity",

Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event.

So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down.",

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair.

So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down.",

This position helps reduce strain on your legs and allows gravity to assist in blood flow [Video 2: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 01:37-01:42].\n\n2. **Leg Movement**: Begin the bicycle exercise by lifting your legs slightly off the ground. As you do this, mimic the pedaling motion of riding a bicycle. This movement engages your leg muscles, promoting circulation.\n\n3. **Toe Position**: While performing the exercise, pull your toes up towards you. This action helps straighten out your legs and encourages blood return from the lower extremities [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n4. **Hold at the Top**: When your legs are extended, hold them at the top of the movement for a moment. This pause enhances the muscle contraction, further aiding blood flow back down to the heart [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Start with a manageable number of repetitions and gradually increase to ",

So now you're working those calf muscles like a pump. So they're being a natural pump to work that fluid and blood back out of the legs. So just up, woo! That's why you need something to hold onto. Up and slowly back down. Just start off with 10 of these and then work your way up to 20 or 25. The last one is going to be a squat. So still keeping your feet about shoulder with the part. You You want to keep your heels down on the ground and then push your bottom back as you squat down. So you want to keep those knees behind the toes. So not going down like this, but really sticking the bottom back only go down as far as you're comfortable. Again, if you feel like you have some balance issues, put a chair behind you. So if you feel like you're falling, you can just sit down in the chair. So nice and slow coming down and then coming back up. So again, just start off with about 10 of these.

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you",

Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity",

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also",

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for",

      "answer": "To improve blood flow and treat varicose veins through squats, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Warm-Up**: Begin by warming up your body to enhance venous flow. This can be achieved using a bear hugger or forced air warming devices, or by applying warm compresses to the affected areas. This initial step is crucial as it prepares the veins for increased blood circulation [Video 1: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 03:47-03:52].\n\n2. **Perform Squats**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Slowly lower your body by bending your knees, keeping your back straight and chest up. Aim to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the ground, then return to the starting position. This movement helps engage the calf muscles, which play a vital role in venous return.\n\n3. **Repetitions**: Start with 10-15 repetitions and gradually increase as your strength improves. It\u2019s important to maintain proper form to avoid injury.\n\n4. **Cool Down**: After completing your squats, cool down with gentle stretching to maintain flexibility and promote relaxation in the muscles.\n\nAlways consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise regimen,",

So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel to help stretch your neck and get that stiffness and tightness out. This is called Snacks. It's a particular technique. It stands for something really long. But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning, then I'm getting that extra stretch in there",

When you're mobilizing things, you really need to make sure that you don't have something where you shouldn't be mobilizing that spine. So if it hurts in any way, hold off and check in with your doctor or your physical therapist. So the next one that you can do is same kind of motion with the chin touch that said now you're just going to do some turns with it. So this time it's not necessarily the up and over like this nags, but you're just going to do that same kind of motion where you're tucking in the chin. Now this time I'm stabilizing with this side and then I'm just going to help do the stretch and overwhelm doing that chin touch. So I'm gonna stabilize here, go into the chin tuck, and then just get that turn. And I don't know if you heard that at all, but for that, I got a little pop, a little adjustment in my neck.

      "answer": "To perform chin tucks for alleviating neck stiffness, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Sit or stand comfortably with your back straight and shoulders relaxed. This position helps maintain proper posture, which is essential for effective chin tucks.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck Movement**: Gently tuck your chin towards your neck. It\u2019s important to note that this is not about lowering your head down; instead, you are drawing your chin straight back, as if trying to create a double chin. This action helps to engage and reset the muscles in your neck, addressing tightness and stiffness [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 01:04-01:05].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain the tucked position for a few seconds, ensuring that you do not strain your neck. Focus on breathing steadily during this hold.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Perform this exercise for several repetitions throughout the day, especially if you experience neck stiffness.\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid forcing the movement or holding the tuck for too long, as this could lead to discomfort. Always listen to your body and consult a healthcare professional if you have persistent neck issues.",

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day.

And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself.

And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into. So I'm doing like that to get that segment stabilized and and then I'm tucking in my chin and going back into extension. So you can see it's that combination moves sometimes it's hard to get down. This one you don't have to hold as long. You can just do it a smooth continuous motion, but if you wanna hold the movement for a little bit, you can hold that three to five. But sometimes this one is since it's a little bit more complicated, it's either easier just to do kind of",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that.

You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

So with this one, the snag, what you're going to do is you're going to grab the towel with your opposite hand here and you're going to stabilize that towel right there, hold it in one spot. So that holds the vertebrae there so you can get the stretch a little bit higher. Then you're going to grab the other hand, make sure you're not choking yourself, but bring it up up and over your ear. So this time you're gonna kind of pull up and over. So you're not just pulling a cross. That's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull. So I'm pulling down with this hand and up and across with this hand. So I'm getting a nice, good stretch in there. And so this one sends us a full stretch. I'm gonna hold it for 30 seconds.

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into.

If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well, you convinced me more that actually works almost better pulling down Brad for the majority of people, but I have had some people that works this way.

This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into. So I'm doing like that to get that segment stabilized and and then I'm tucking in my chin and going back into extension. So you can see it's that combination moves sometimes it's hard to get down. This one you don't have to hold as long. You can just do it a smooth continuous motion, but if you wanna hold the movement for a little bit, you can hold that three to five.

I'm gonna hold it for 30 seconds. And then after that 30 seconds, if you wanna switch sides, You can, so now I'm holding it with this one right over here and then grabbing this one and coming up and over. So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into.

If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well, you convinced me more that actually works almost better pulling down Brad for the majority of people, but I have had some people that works this way.

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

Little paws come back in and relax and reset myself. So again, you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations. But if you can get it right, you're really gonna get that stiffness out of there. So it works really, really well. So the next one is gonna just be a levator scapula stretch. And that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward",

So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my",

So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down here and remember be safe don't follow over when you're stretching, how fun and how we feel that are seen.",

This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury. Or another one, such as a couple tunnels in drone, passive, risk flexion and extension. To stretch through risk flexors, point your fingers up in your elbows, extend it nice and straight. Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors. Make sure your arm is nice and straight and your elbow is locked out. This is a great way to mobilize and stretch the wrist for any wrist demanding movement tasks. For example, gymnastics, yoga, Olympic weightlifting, woodworking, or any repetitive strain in juicing tasks such as desewer, body weighted wrist stretches. To stretch the wrist flexors, find a table or bench that plays the palm of your hand on top of the table and lean and body weight on them. This should create a slight",

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, get that good stretch in there. I like to alternate back and forth. You don't have to, you can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate back and forth, give the muscle a little time to relax and reset. And then the last one is going to be an upper trap stretch, which is the big muscle over all of those. And that's another one that holds a lot of stress and tightness and stiffness. And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fist and kind of push downwards, but again this is to hold that shoulder down to get the best stretch. You don't have to do this part, but it's really going to get a better stretch because then when you go into the stretch your shoulders not going to come up. So this time you really are just going pulling almost your ear towards the shoulder. So you're really just going to go to the",

So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all. So again, holding that for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side, if you've got just some general next stiffness, and you can do that a couple of times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side. So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, get that good stretch in there. I like to alternate back and forth. You don't have to, you can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate back and forth, give the muscle a little time to relax and reset. And then the last one is going to be an upper trap stretch, which is the big muscle over all of those. And that's another one that holds a lot of stress and tightness and stiffness. And since",

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this.

Take the way. Bob, the neck has a lot of different reasons it could be stiff and painful. These particular exercises in my and I think you'll agree in our opinion was going to cover a great majority of them and I have them in a specific order for a reason because I think particularly steps two and three you do the number two first and then three and they complement each other in that order. But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques.

Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand.

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on that and that works really well. You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves.

When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up",

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

So if it hurts in any way, hold off and check in with your doctor or your physical therapist. So the next one that you can do is same kind of motion with the chin touch that said now you're just going to do some turns with it. So this time it's not necessarily the up and over like this nags, but you're just going to do that same kind of motion where you're tucking in the chin. Now this time I'm stabilizing with this side and then I'm just going to help do the stretch and overwhelm doing that chin touch. So I'm gonna stabilize here, go into the chin tuck, and then just get that turn. And I don't know if you heard that at all, but for that, I got a little pop, a little adjustment in my neck. And as long as that's not painful, that's fine. So again, this one just a little bit more continuous movement to get that mobilization in there. So I'm gonna do the other way so you can see it. So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin, and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little paws come back in and relax and reset myself.

I'm gonna hold it for 30 seconds. And then after that 30 seconds, if you wanna switch sides, You can, so now I'm holding it with this one right over here and then grabbing this one and coming up and over. So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side.

So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline.

Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful",

You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves.

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden",

Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from",

To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest. To stretch the forearm muscles for golfers elbow, you're going to exaggerate a very slow wave so that palm of your hand lands on the table top and bench where your fingers point backwards. Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

          "text": "AJ here with Strong Life Physiotherapy. How can you sell if you have tennis elbow or lateral elbow condolitis? First look at the area of the pain. Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

The biceps muscle consists of both a long and short head, which should be clearly defined [Video 1: t8AU9mWIsqI, Time: 00:39-00:41].\n\n3. **Palpation**: Gently palpate the biceps muscle. Start at the mid-belly of the muscle and move towards the tendons. Pay special attention to the tendon of the long head, which runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicipital groove of the humerus. This tendon is often a site for irritation and degeneration, so check for tenderness or abnormal texture [Video 1].\n\n4. **Assess Function**: Ask the patient to flex their elbow against resistance to assess muscle strength and function. \n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure the patient",

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

To practice drawing arterial blood with the venapukshar trainer, do the following. Fill a ten milliliter syringe with fake blood and connect to the smaller vein and let it run through the tube. Now tightly occlude one side of the smaller vein. Ask a person to sit opposite from you and have them press down on the plunger of the syringe with moderate pulsating pressure to simulate the pulsations of an artery. Perform",

This prevents frostbite and skin damage, which can occur if ice is applied directly.\n\n3. **Application**: Place the wrapped ice pack on the affected area where you are experiencing swelling or pain. Make sure it covers the area adequately for maximum effect.\n\n4. **Timing**: Keep the ice pack on the injury for about 15-20 minutes. This duration is effective for reducing swelling and alleviating pain.\n\n5. **Frequency**: You can repeat this process every 1-2 hours as needed, especially within the first 48 hours after the injury.\n\nAlways monitor your skin for any adverse reactions, and discontinue use if you experience excessive discomfort or skin changes [Video 1].",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze.

Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records.

Place other items like used gloves and all items contaminated with blood or body fluids into the infectious waste bag. Recheck labels and requisition forms for accuracy. Perform hand hygiene. Monitor the site and extremity for a while for any sign of circulatory problems, nerve damage, or any other complications. To practice drawing arterial blood with the venapukshar trainer, do the following. Fill a ten milliliter syringe with fake blood and connect to the smaller vein and let it run through the tube. Now tightly occlude one side of the smaller vein. Ask a person to sit opposite from you and have them press down on the plunger of the syringe with moderate pulsating pressure to simulate the pulsations of an artery. Perform",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin.

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove.

Following videos will show you how to clean your skin with CHG wipes, and if needed, use Mupirus and nasal swabs. These instructions are for how to use anti-sap-dic chloroxidine glutinate wipes. When your skin with CHG wipes helps prevent infections. Except for face and underarms, do not shave, wax, remove body hair before the day of surgery. In addition to the day of surgery, your surgery preparation team will tell you how many nights before surgery you need to use the wipes. This will be either one or five nights. Do not use powder, deodorant or lotion. First, wash your hair, face and body with your regular shampoo, conditioner and soap. Then rinse off the regular shampoo, conditioner and soap thoroughly. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel. Cover yourself with a towel or clean garment and wait 15 minutes. Remove garment and apply CHG wipes to cool dry skin as directed in the following video. In the morning of surgery, do not bathe or wash your hair. Do not use powder, deodorant or lotion.",

The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

Pat your skin dry with a clean towel. Cover yourself with a towel or clean garment and wait 15 minutes. Remove garment and apply CHG wipes to cool dry skin as directed in the following video. In the morning of surgery, do not bathe or wash your hair. Do not use powder, deodorant or lotion. Apply the wipes to cool dry skin as directed in the video to follow. Step 1. Use one wipe for your neck and chest. Be sure to focus on the center of your chest. Step 2. Use one wipe for both arms, starting with the shoulder and ending at the fingertips. Be sure to include your underarm and the entire circumference of your arm. Step 3. Use one wipe for your right and left hip, followed by your groin. Wipe the folds in the abdominal and groin areas. Be sure to avoid the genitals. Step 4. Use one wipe for your right leg and foot, starting at the thigh and ending at the toes. Be sure to include the entire circumference of your leg and foot.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully.

The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame.

The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right, and I'm going to bend it because what we're going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw backwards.

If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

To go down, you go down with your crutches first, then your injured leg comes forward, And you put the weight through your hands to step with your left foot. One step at a time. So I'll always remember to follow your doctor's orders as far as how much weight you can put through your injured leg. But if you keep things to remember when using crutches will help you heal and get home safely. Remember not to lean your armpits onto the top of the crutches. Remember to always stand tall and you're going to move your crutches forward before you step with your uningered side.",

So, this is going to apply this dressing to the key, okay, okay, okay, what up for me? Thanks, sir. Check the circulation by pressing a near bed or skin beyond the bandage for 5 seconds. Release the pressure. At the color does not return within 2 seconds, the bandage is too tight. If blood shows will addressing, don't remove it. Just apply a second bandage on top. If bloodshed through both dressings, remove them and apply",

The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to",

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video.

Do not use ice, because it may further damage the injured skin. Avoid touching the wound with bare hands or unsteer alobjects. Avoid applying ghee, butter or any oil as it increases the chance of infection. Do not break blisters that may develop. If blisters break, clean the area by running tap water over it. Apply an over-the-counter antibiotic or a burn ointment. Leave the burn alone for 24 hours. Don't cover the burn and less clothing robes on it. If it shrubs, cover it with a gauze pad tape twell away from the burn. Move the dressing every day and clean the wound, cover it again. If the irritation and pain does not subside, do not hesitate to seek for medical help.",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this.

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Here, we'll demonstrate manual defibrillation using external paddles. After assessing your patient and determining that defibrillation is necessary, connecting the paddles cable to the device and applying the paddles to the patient's bare chest, set the therapy knob to the desired energy for the patient. Then, press the charge button on the paddle. The orange shock buttons on the paddles flash to indicate the defibrillator is charged, and the patient contact indicator lights turn green, once proper skin contact is made. Make sure no one is touching the patient, or anything connected to the patient. Press shock buttons simultaneously located on the paddles. Upon delivery of the shock, the heart start in trepid announces, shock delivered. Following successful defibrillation, the jewels delivered displays, and the shock counter will increment accordingly. Following successful defibrillation, and after you confirm a stable heart rhythm, return the therapy knob to monitor.",

Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all. So again, holding that for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side, if you've got just some general next stiffness, and you can do that a couple of times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side. So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, get that good stretch in there.

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my",

Ensure you have a stable surface to hold onto for balance if needed.\n\n2. **Bend One Knee**: Gently bend one knee and bring your heel towards your buttocks. This movement targets the quadriceps muscle at the front of your thigh.\n\n3. **Grab Your Ankle**: With the same-side hand, reach back and grasp your ankle or foot. If you cannot reach your ankle comfortably, do not force it; instead, bring your leg back just a little bit to avoid strain on your knee joint.\n\n4. **Align Your Hips**: Make sure your hips remain aligned and your knees are close together. This helps in effectively stretching the quadriceps without putting undue pressure on the knee joint.\n\n5. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply to relax your muscles. If you feel discomfort in your knee rather than your quadriceps, adjust your position to ensure you are feeling the stretch in the muscle belly area instead [Video 1: r21kAatSVqc, Time: ",

If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better.

It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's",

So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is find a wine cork. Of course, I prefer the Buffalo TMJ Kick, the click corks, but you could really use any old wine cork for many old wine bottles. What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back",

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is",

He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to",

I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable",

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's",

This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better. In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension. He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then",

Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better. In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension.

If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

      "answer": "To apply moist heat for reducing muscle tension in the case of a locked jaw, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Heat Source**: Use a moist heat pack, which can be heated in a microwave. Place the pack in the microwave for about 1.5 to 2 minutes. Ensure that it is heated evenly to avoid hot spots that could cause burns [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:05-04:08].\n\n2. **Check Temperature**: After heating, carefully remove the pack from the microwave. Test the temperature on a small area of your skin to ensure it is warm but not too hot to avoid burns.\n\n3. **Application**: Once the temperature is deemed safe, apply the moist heat pack directly to the area of tension in the jaw. The moist heat is more penetrating than dry heat, making it more effective for muscle relaxation.\n\n4. **Duration**: Keep the heat pack on the affected area for about 15-20 minutes. This duration allows the heat to penetrate deeply and help alleviate tension.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always monitor the skin for any signs of irritation or burns during the application. If discomfort occurs, remove the heat pack",

          "text": "two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I",

If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

          "text": "Hi, I'm Dr. Jeff Dogus and today I'm going to show you how to unlock a locked jaw. First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem.

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is",

He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings.

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension. He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to",

It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's",

If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem.

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse.

Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is find a wine cork. Of course, I prefer the Buffalo TMJ Kick, the click corks, but you could really use any old wine cork for many old wine bottles. What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back",

And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint.

I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other.

Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is",

And I want you to gently roll it back and forth, side to side, front and back, and just play with it. Let the muscles relax as you're doing this, and play with it as much as you want over the course of a day, as much as your muscles can tolerate. You don't want to push it too hard and you don't want the muscles to get sore. And of course you don't want to overwork or overstrain these compromised joints. Now even though I can't guarantee that this is going to work for you, I can tell you that it is possible and it's safe. I just had a patient last week who I set home with a cork and her jaw unlocked within a few days. The last thing that I want to say is I want to stress to you that even if your jaw unlocks, it's very, very likely that it's going to become locked again. When you clench in your back teeth, you're going to drive the condile behind the disc again and there's a good chance you'll get stuck there.

      "answer": "To attempt to unlock a locked jaw using a cork, follow these steps while prioritizing safety. First, it's crucial to understand that forcibly manipulating a locked jaw can worsen the issue. Therefore, avoid any aggressive attempts to open the jaw, as advised in the video [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 01:16-01:20].\n\n1. **Gather Materials**: Obtain a cork, which can be used as a tool to gently assist in unlocking the jaw.\n2. **Position the Cork**: Place the cork between your molars on one side of your mouth. This should be done gently to avoid any pain or further locking.\n3. **Gentle Pressure**: Apply gentle pressure by slowly biting down on the cork. This action may help in gradually loosening the tension in the jaw muscles.\n4. **Relax and Breathe**: While applying pressure, focus on relaxing your jaw and breathing deeply. This can help reduce muscle tension.\n5. **Monitor Pain**: If you experience any significant pain or discomfort, stop immediately. \n\nRemember, if the jaw remains locked or if pain persists, seek professional medical advice rather than attempting further self-treatment.",

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what",

So as the biggest of course to the abdomen, it influences the microbiome, the 2.2 million genes that are of bacterial origin, and the decent funds of course the human genome. So you have 23,000 human genes, but you have 2.2 million bacterial genes, and these cross-talk with the human genome, they produce metabolites which influence everything that's happening in the body. Also, there are hormones produced like brellin, reptile, leptin and also all kinds of other very interesting chemicals such as what you call it. Dopamine serotonin, oxytocin, opiate, all these hormones that make us feel good are also immunomodilators. And so, here's Michael Johnson's thing. Think of ourselves as Octopus, the mercenary recently delineated as an organ, his intelligent and its idiosyncratic weight, got extinct, instinct, third chakra. The mercenary looks like an octopus. Yes, the mercenary has been know identified as a very important organ that may be involved in many things. So now we can see the gut brain access traffic by natural and so many things are improved if the vagus nerve is simulated. But it's good for decreasing risk of heart disease, increasing your lung capacity, bringing about self-regulation in the body in general. So just in class, there's yogic breathing, stimulate, see how it does. So now let me actually decide to tell you all the ways that you could probably simulate your biggest love to improve your well-being in general by augmenting self-regulation or what you call it homeostasis and therefore healing.

This practice helps to enhance vagal tone, which is beneficial for mental health [Video 1: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 11:13-11:19].\n\n2. **Meditation**: Incorporate meditation into your daily routine. This practice not only calms the mind but also stimulates the vagus nerve, promoting a sense of well-being.\n\n3. **Laughter**: Include laughter in your day. It has been shown to increase vagal tone, which can further support mental health improvements.\n\n4. **Probiotics**: If you have digestive concerns, consider taking probiotics, as they may support overall gut health, which is linked to the vagus nerve's function.\n\n**Safety Notes**: Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new health regimen, especially if you have existing health conditions.

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip.

So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that.

They're in the plane ready to go on a mission. Sure. So it's called box breathing. So you can picture a box and you're going to pick the length of time. Like you can do anywhere from like three seconds all the way up to nine seconds for each side of the box. Right. So you're going to breathe in, inhale, let's take three seconds. Okay. And you do it, Brad. Okay. I'm going to be talking. Inhale for three seconds, hold for three seconds, one, two, three, exhale for three seconds, and then hold one more time for three seconds. There you go. Start it again. And then start it again. And you decide what length works for you. Brad and I were just discussing this. The next one's called 478. I always do a little variation of that. I'll hold it longer than they recommend and you said to you I hold a less than 7 seconds and this one you find the one that works for you again three seconds in hold three seconds out hold that real simple to do next one is four seven eight yeah this is my favorite this is the one I'll use at night sometimes or in the car in this one you breathe in for four hold for seven which is quite a good",

Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right.

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

Right? And and another thing with relaxation in I keto is like this really works, it could really make your stress level from here down here just by focusing on how you breathe and I can you can do these things in your car if you're stressed out on on the way to work or on the way home, you know, bad. That's where I usually do it Brad, I use it. I did this morning. Yeah. I know I was going to be meeting with you. And it's big stuff that things come down so. But you know, when I talk to people or anxious, I can see their breathing is rapid, right? And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that",

So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right. And you want to need to find out which one of these works best for you. And maybe or even a little variation of one of these. But pick the time about what length you want to go. I can't recommend this enough red. I mean, it's just people get anxiety attacks and stuff like that. It's always the shallow breathing on them that you can see. All right, thanks. Good luck with it.

Right? And and another thing with relaxation in I keto is like this really works, it could really make your stress level from here down here just by focusing on how you breathe and I can you can do these things in your car if you're stressed out on on the way to work or on the way home, you know, bad.

And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that",

It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that you do diaphragmatic breathing and that's basically belly breathing. So instead of when you breathe in, you're not trying to expand your chest, you're trying to expand the diaphragm, which is in the belly. Right. So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that. And then you, a lot of times, they recommend perspreading, which is your blowing, it's like you're blowing out a candle.

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what",

It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that you do diaphragmatic breathing and that's basically belly breathing. So instead of when you breathe in, you're not trying to expand your chest, you're trying to expand the diaphragm, which is in the belly. Right. So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the",

And you do it, Brad. Okay. I'm going to be talking. Inhale for three seconds, hold for three seconds, one, two, three, exhale for three seconds, and then hold one more time for three seconds. There you go. Start it again. And then start it again. And you decide what length works for you. Brad and I were just discussing this. The next one's called 478.

It takes me some. The third one, which by the way seems to fit with the name, I guess you'd call it third breathing. Sure. So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right. And you want to need to find out which one of these works best for you. And maybe or even a little variation of one of these. But pick the time about what length you want to go. I can't recommend this enough red. I mean, it's just people get anxiety attacks and stuff like that. It's always the shallow breathing on them that you can see. All right, thanks. Good luck with it. And remember Brad and I can fix just about anything. Except for a broken heart. We're working on it. Yeah, they did.",

If you draw a line through this mole shown here, the two halves will not match, meaning it is asymmetrical, a warning sign for melanoma. B stands for border irregularity. A benign mole generally has smooth and even borders as shown here. The borders of a melanoma, as shown here, may be uneven with scalloped, notched, or trailing edges. C stands for color variation. Most benign moles have one or two evenly distributed colors. Having a variety of colors, including brown, black, white, red, and or blue may be a feature of melanoma. D stands for diameter greater than half a centimeter. Although melanomas may be larger and diameter than the eraser head on your pencil, they may sometimes be smaller when first detected. The last letter E stands for evolution. In most cases, benign moles are stable over time. time. Be on alert when a mole starts to evolve or change in any way. When a mole is evolving, see a doctor. Any change in size, shape, color, texture, elevation, or any new symptom, such as bleeding, itching or scabbing, maybe a sign of malignancy. Thanks for watching!",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

When your skin with CHG wipes helps prevent infections. Except for face and underarms, do not shave, wax, remove body hair before the day of surgery. In addition to the day of surgery, your surgery preparation team will tell you how many nights before surgery you need to use the wipes. This will be either one or five nights. Do not use powder, deodorant or lotion. First, wash your hair, face and body with your regular shampoo, conditioner and soap. Then rinse off the regular shampoo, conditioner and soap thoroughly. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel. Cover yourself with a towel or clean garment and wait 15 minutes. Remove garment and apply CHG wipes to cool dry skin as directed in the following video. In the morning of surgery, do not bathe or wash your hair. Do not use powder, deodorant or lotion. Apply the wipes to cool dry skin as directed in the video to follow. Step 1. Use one wipe for your neck and chest. Be sure to focus on the center of your chest. Step 2. Use one wipe for both arms, starting with the shoulder and ending at the fingertips.

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip. If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring loaded land set that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the bone so it releases the land set to pump your skin for the blood sample. So often as he patients blood glucose meters and their control solution has never even been opened.

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now.",

I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back",

But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

Ensure your body is straight and supported comfortably [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:53-05:00].\n\n2. **Elbow Position**: Bend your elbow to a 90-degree angle. This position is crucial as it helps isolate the rotator cuff muscles during the exercise.\n\n3. **Weight Selection**: Use a light dumbbell or resistance band that allows you to perform the exercise with control. Start with a manageable weight to avoid straining your shoulder.\n\n4. **Movement**: Keeping your elbow close to your body, rotate your forearm upward, lifting the dumbbell towards the ceiling. Ensure that your shoulder remains stable and does not rise during the movement.\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Perform 10-15 repetitions for 2-3 sets, ensuring you maintain proper form throughout.\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid using a weight that is too heavy, as this can lead to shoulder strain.

My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down.

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through",

And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden",

The weight should be positioned directly in front of you, pointing down towards the ground.\n\n3. **Movement**: Rotate your upper arm upward towards the ceiling while keeping your elbow glued to your side. This rotation should be controlled and deliberate, focusing on the movement of the shoulder joint rather than the elbow.\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Perform the exercise for a set number of repetitions, ensuring that you maintain proper form throughout.\n\n**Safety Notes**: Avoid using a weight that is too heavy, as this can lead to improper form and potential injury. Start with a lighter weight to ensure that you can perform the exercise correctly and without strain [Video 1].",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down.

Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like.

So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back",

And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their",

Attach a handle to the cable and adjust the weight to a manageable level to avoid strain.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Grab the handle with the hand opposite the machine. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and bend your elbow to a 90-degree angle, keeping your upper arm close to your body.\n\n3. **Execution**: Begin the exercise by rotating your forearm outward, away from your body. Ensure that your elbow remains fixed at the 90-degree angle throughout the movement. This action targets the external rotators of the rotator cuff.\n\n4. **Control**: As you perform the motion, maintain control and resist the pull of the cable. This helps to effectively engage the rotator cuff muscles [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:27-04:34].\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Perform 10-15 repetitions for 2-3 sets, ensuring proper form to prevent injury.\n\n**Safety Note**: Start with lighter weights to focus on technique",
