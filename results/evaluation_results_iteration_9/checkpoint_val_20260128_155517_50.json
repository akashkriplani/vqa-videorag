          "text": "I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for part few health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the blade. Stop the blade is very simple. Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Apply an over-the-counter antibiotic or a burn ointment. Leave the burn alone for 24 hours. Don't cover the burn and less clothing robes on it. If it shrubs, cover it with a gauze pad tape twell away from the burn. Move the dressing every day and clean the wound, cover it again. If the irritation and pain does not subside, do not hesitate to seek for medical help.",

Just put the turnicant on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super, super tight. Then we're going to take the handle. We're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it. And we're going to write the time.

      "answer": "To apply pressure on a wound effectively, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess the Situation**: Approach the bleeding patient calmly and ensure that the environment is safe for both you and the patient.\n\n2. **Apply Direct Pressure**: Use the palm of your hand to cover the wound completely. If it's a large wound, apply your entire palm and body weight onto the area to exert maximum pressure. This is crucial as it helps to stop the bleeding [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:54-01:01].\n\n3. **Maintain Pressure**: Once you have applied pressure, it is essential to keep it maintained until professional help arrives. Do not lift your hand to check if the bleeding has stopped, as this could disrupt the clotting process and cause the bleeding to resume [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:54-01:01].\n\n4. **Monitor the Patient**: Keep an eye on the patient\u2019s condition. If the bleeding does not stop, be prepared to move to the next steps, such as wound packing or applying a tourniquet, if necessary [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe. If you don't see blood, you have missed the artery and will have to withdraw the needle somewhat and then re-aign the syringe toward the pulsating artery. Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure. Place the syringe onto the ice, pack ice cubes over the syringe, and send it off to the lab right away, arterial blood gas or ABG samples should be analyzed within 10 minutes of collection for accurate results.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

This helps to control bleeding. Maintain this pressure until help arrives or until further action is necessary [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:54-01:01].\n\n2. **Prepare for Packing**: If the bleeding does not stop with pressure alone, you will need to pack the wound with gauze. You can use hemostatic gauze, standard gauze, or even a clean piece of clothing if gauze is unavailable [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 01:12-01:17].\n\n3. **Pack the Wound**: Take the gauze and begin to pack it into the wound. Ensure that you push the gauze in firmly until you cannot pack it any further. This step is crucial as it helps to reach the source of the bleeding and provides necessary pressure to control it [Video 1].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always wear gloves if available to minimize the risk of infection and protect yourself from blood exposure. If the bleeding persists, consider applying",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results.

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms hang down, the wrists should come up even with the handles here. Right, so if they're like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well. And these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other right. But first, how do we make sure that the height is right down there? That's good point. Let's make sure",

Yes, which you're going to find out how useful this can be for after surgery as well as before surgery. So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant. Just put the turnicant on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super, super tight. Then we're going to take the handle. We're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it. And we're going to write the time.

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

It is easy to go straight through the radial artery if you rush, you may feel a slight give as the needle penetrates the wall of the radial artery. Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe. If you don't see blood, you have missed the artery and will have to withdraw the needle somewhat and then re-aign the syringe toward the pulsating artery. Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure.

          "text": "Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video.

Use the palm of your hand and apply your full weight to help stop the bleeding. Maintain this pressure until help arrives or the bleeding stops [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:54-01:01].\n\n2. **Wound Packing**: If the bleeding does not stop with pressure alone, proceed to pack the wound. Use hemostatic gauze if available, but any clean gauze or even a shirt can suffice in emergencies. Carefully pack the gauze into the wound, ensuring you fill it as much as possible to reach the source of the bleeding [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 01:12-01:17].\n\n3. **Monitor the Situation**: After packing the wound, continue to apply pressure. Keep an eye on the wound for any signs of continued bleeding and be prepared to adjust your packing or apply additional gauze if necessary.\n\nAlways ensure that your hands are clean or wear gloves if available to minimize the risk of infection. If the wound is severe, seek professional medical help as soon as possible",

And as you exhale, start rolling forward so that you're drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Just notice that soreness, gosh, wow, we carry so much in that region, don't we? let's take it now to the rear. And so to the front and to the back you do it maybe about 30 to 45 seconds. Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully. And again, inhale up, exhale it down, just one more, inhale up, exhale it out.

So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my",

You don't have to, you can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate back and forth, give the muscle a little time to relax and reset. And then the last one is going to be an upper trap stretch, which is the big muscle over all of those. And that's another one that holds a lot of stress and tightness and stiffness. And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fist and kind of push downwards, but again this is to hold that shoulder down to get the best stretch. You don't have to do this part, but it's really going to get a better stretch because then when you go into the stretch your shoulders not going to come up.

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

Over time, that can lead to pain and pinching and inflammation irritation, even like a rotator calf tear, which we absolutely want to avoid. If we do the right exercises for it, we actually can't avoid that. Now, if you do have those symptoms that pain in your shoulder, I did shoot a video, it's just last week, all about shoulder impingement. It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a",

Ensure your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed. This position helps in effectively releasing tension [Video 1: CvW-Zq3NlkU, Time: 00:27-00:33].\n\n2. **Shoulder Rolls**: Bring your fingertips to your shoulders. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, start rolling your shoulders forward in a circular motion. Imagine drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Continue this for a few breaths to help release built-up tension [Video 1: CvW-Zq3NlkU, Time: 00:27-00:33].\n\n3. **Stretching**: You can also incorporate a levator scapula stretch. This targets the muscles around your shoulder blade and neck, which often hold a lot of stress. Gently tilt your head to one side while keeping your shoulders down to feel a stretch [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 06:51-06:54].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you perform these movements gently to avoid straining",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique.

But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side.

So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented.

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay.

This can be achieved using a bear hugger or forced air warming devices. Additionally, applying warm compresses to the extremities can help dilate the veins, making them more prominent [Video 2: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 03:47-03:52].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Ensure the patient is in a comfortable position that allows for easy access to the veins. Elevating the arm may also assist in venous distension.\n\n3. **Hydration**: If possible, ensure the patient is well-hydrated, as dehydration can lead to smaller veins. \n\n4. **Gentle Tapping**: Lightly tap the area where you intend to insert the needle. This can stimulate blood flow and help the veins to become more visible.\n\n5. **Reverse Smark Technique**: For difficult cases, consider using the reverse Smark technique, which is specifically designed for challenging venous access situations [Video 1: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins.

Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins.

Assess the extremities for temperature and condition; they should be warm and free of any obstruction.\n\n2. **Warming the Extremities**: Before starting the procedure, warm the patient's extremities using a bear hugger or forced air warming devices, or apply warm compresses. This helps to dilate the veins and improve venous flow, making them more prominent for access [Video 1: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 03:47-03:52].\n\n3. **Application of the Reverse Esmarch Technique**: Begin by wrapping an elastic bandage or Esmarch bandage around the limb, starting at the distal end (fingers or toes) and moving proximally. This creates a temporary constriction that helps engorge the veins with blood.\n\n4. **Finding the Vein**: Once the bandage is applied, gently release the distal end to allow blood to flow back into the veins. This should make the veins more visible and easier to palpate for cannulation.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right, and I'm going to bend it because what we're going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw backwards. So this is the first part. I'm going to take my right hand, I'm going to place on the opposite side of the door frame and I'm going to pull into my body weight, I should say,",

So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands or I should say your arms. And you're going to, again, put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame. Just like this. Put your feet together. And then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. So with this, it should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those peck muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region. Those are the rhomboids where the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by",

And as you exhale, start rolling forward so that you're drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Just notice that soreness, gosh, wow, we carry so much in that region, don't we? let's take it now to the rear. And so to the front and to the back you do it maybe about 30 to 45 seconds. Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully. And again, inhale up, exhale it down, just one more, inhale up, exhale it out.

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit.

The towel will act as a cushion during the exercise [Video 2: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 01:43-01:47].\n\n2. **Position the Towel**: Roll the towel up and place it behind your upper back, between your shoulder blades. This will help support your posture during the exercise.\n\n3. **Utilize the Doorframe**: Stand in the doorway and place your hands on either side of the doorframe at shoulder height. Ensure your elbows are slightly bent and your shoulders are relaxed.\n\n4. **Perform the Push-Pull Exercise**: Gently push against the doorframe while simultaneously pulling your shoulders back and down. This movement helps counteract the forward rounding of the shoulders and reduces muscle tension [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 01:08-01:13].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure that you do not overexert yourself during this exercise.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands or I should say your arms. And you're going to, again, put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame. Just like this. Put your feet together. And then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. So with this, it should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those peck muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region. Those are the rhomboids where the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by",

Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully.

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

      "answer": "To reset forward rounded shoulders using a doorframe, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find a Doorframe**: Stand in front of a doorframe where you can comfortably lean into it. This exercise is designed to help bring your shoulders back and alleviate muscle tension.\n\n2. **Use a Towel**: Grab a hand washing towel to serve as a cushion for your hands. This will help protect your shoulders during the exercise [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 01:43-01:47].\n\n3. **Positioning**: Place your hands on the doorframe at shoulder height. Ensure your elbows are slightly bent and your body is positioned so that you can lean into the frame.\n\n4. **Lean Forward**: Gently lean your body weight into the doorframe. This action will create a push-pull effect that helps to reset the position of your shoulders.\n\n5. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for a few seconds, allowing your shoulders to stretch and realign. Repeat as necessary to help reduce tension and improve posture [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 01:08-01:13].\n\n**Safety Note**: If you",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you",

Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to",

So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down.",

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time.

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds.

      "answer": "To improve blood flow and treat varicose veins by raising your legs, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Lie down on a flat surface, such as a bed or mat. Elevate your legs above the level of your heart. You can use pillows or cushions to support your legs, ensuring they are comfortably propped up. This position utilizes gravity to aid venous return, reducing pressure in the veins.\n\n2. **Leg Exercises**: While your legs are elevated, perform gentle exercises. A simple exercise is to do a straight leg raise. Pull your toes towards you to help straighten out your leg. Hold the position briefly at the top to enhance blood flow back towards the heart. This engages the muscles and promotes circulation [Video 3: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n3. **Duration**: Maintain this elevated position for 15-30 minutes several times a day, especially after prolonged periods of standing or sitting.\n\n**Safety Considerations**: Ensure that the elevation does not cause discomfort or strain. If you experience pain or numbness, adjust your position or consult a healthcare professional. Always listen to your body while performing these exercises. \n\nBy",

Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it. Most of the time, you should be able to get rid of the pain by doing what I've shown you. If not, come in for a visit. The sooner you come in, the easier it is to treat and the faster you get better.

And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down.",

      "answer": "To improve blood flow and treat varicose veins through a bicycle leg exercise, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by lying on your back. You can prop one leg up for support if needed. This position helps reduce strain on your veins and utilizes gravity to assist venous return [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n2. **Leg Movement**: Begin performing a straight leg raise. As you lift your leg, pull your toes towards you. This action helps to straighten out the leg and engages the muscles effectively [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n3. **Hold Position**: At the top of the leg raise, hold the position briefly. This pause encourages blood flow back down the leg, which is beneficial for managing varicose veins [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat this exercise for several repetitions, ensuring you maintain a controlled movement to avoid strain.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always consult with a healthcare provider before",

So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair. But just lift your heels up off the ground and then slowly come back down. So now you're working those calf muscles like a pump. So they're being a natural pump to work that fluid and blood back out of the legs. So just up, woo! That's why you need something to hold onto. Up and slowly back down.

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins.

This position helps reduce strain while allowing you to focus on your calf muscles.\n\n2. **Calf Raises**: Slowly lift your heels off the ground, rising onto the balls of your feet. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds to allow blood to flow back down effectively. Start with 10 repetitions, and as you become more comfortable, gradually increase to 15, 20, or even 25 repetitions [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 02:06-02:12].\n\n3. **Heel Raises**: If you find the calf raises uncomfortable, consider performing a motion similar to a stair stepper in reverse. Push your feet down and back up in a controlled manner [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 02:46-02:52].\n\n4. **Duration**: Aim for a total of 30 seconds to 2 minutes of activity, depending on your endurance level [Video 1",

Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity",

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time.

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down.",

So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for",

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel to help stretch your neck and get that stiffness and tightness out. This is called Snacks. It's a particular technique. It stands for something really long. But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning, then I'm getting that extra stretch in there",

When you're mobilizing things, you really need to make sure that you don't have something where you shouldn't be mobilizing that spine. So if it hurts in any way, hold off and check in with your doctor or your physical therapist. So the next one that you can do is same kind of motion with the chin touch that said now you're just going to do some turns with it. So this time it's not necessarily the up and over like this nags, but you're just going to do that same kind of motion where you're tucking in the chin. Now this time I'm stabilizing with this side and then I'm just going to help do the stretch and overwhelm doing that chin touch. So I'm gonna stabilize here, go into the chin tuck, and then just get that turn. And I don't know if you heard that at all, but for that, I got a little pop, a little adjustment in my neck. And as long as that's not painful, that's fine. So again, this one just a little bit more continuous movement to get that mobilization in there. So I'm gonna do the",

Ensure your head is in a neutral position, looking straight ahead.\n\n2. **Performing the Chin Tuck**: Gently pull your chin straight back towards your neck, as if you are trying to create a double chin. It\u2019s important to focus on moving your head backward rather than tucking it down. This action helps to reset the muscles in your neck and alleviate tightness [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 01:04-01:05].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain the chin tuck for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat this exercise several times throughout the day, especially if you experience stiffness.\n\n4. **Frequency**: Incorporate chin tucks into your daily routine, as they can be done anywhere and are effective for reducing neck stiffness [Video 1].\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid excessive force during the tuck; the movement should be gentle to prevent strain. If you experience pain, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

So you're not just pulling a cross. That's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull.

Ensure your neck is relaxed.\n\n2. **Positioning the Towel**: Place the towel around your neck, positioning it just above your shoulders. Hold one end of the towel with one hand and the other end with the opposite hand, creating a gentle pull.\n\n3. **Stretching**: Tilt your head towards the side where you are holding the towel, pulling down gently with the hand on that side while simultaneously pulling the towel up and over with the other hand. This should be done near your ear, not directly on your neck, to avoid strain [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:27-03:29].\n\n4. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for about 30 seconds. Repeat this stretch three times on each side for optimal results. If pressed for time, two repetitions on each side are acceptable [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:39-03:41].\n\n5. **Chin Tucks**: You can also perform chin tucks while stabilizing",

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself.

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into.

So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into. So I'm doing like that to get that segment stabilized and and then I'm tucking in my chin and going back into extension. So you can see it's that combination moves sometimes it's hard to get down. This one you don't have to hold as long. You can just do it a smooth continuous motion, but if you wanna hold the movement for a little bit, you can hold that three to five.

      "answer": "To perform neck extensions using a towel to alleviate neck stiffness, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Towel**: Roll a towel into a cylindrical shape. This will serve as a support for your neck during the exercise [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n2. **Position the Towel**: Place the rolled towel behind your neck, ensuring it is positioned at the base of your skull. This will provide the necessary support for the neck extension.\n\n3. **Perform the Extension**: Gently lean your head back over the towel, allowing your neck to extend. Hold this position for about 30 seconds. It is important to ensure that you are not experiencing any pain during this movement. If you feel discomfort, stop immediately [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim to perform this stretch three times. If you are short on time, doing it twice on each side is acceptable, but three is optimal for better results [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:27-",

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well, you convinced me more that actually works almost better pulling down Brad for the majority of people, but I have had some people that works this way.

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics.

The towel should not be directly on your neck but rather supporting the area around it [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:27-03:29].\n\n3. **Perform Neck Turns**: Gently turn your head to one side while holding the towel in place. You can assist the stretch by using your hands to apply gentle pressure, pulling down with one hand while pushing up with the other. Hold this position for about 30 seconds [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:27-03:29].\n\n4. **Repeat**: Perform this stretch on both sides, ideally three times on each side.

So the next one is gonna just be a levator scapula stretch. And that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the",

So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my",

So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down here and remember be safe don't follow over when you're stretching, how fun and how we feel that are seen.",

This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury. Or another one, such as a couple tunnels in drone, passive, risk flexion and extension. To stretch through risk flexors, point your fingers up in your elbows, extend it nice and straight. Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors. Make sure your arm is nice and straight and your elbow is locked out. This is a great way to mobilize and stretch the wrist for any wrist demanding movement tasks. For example, gymnastics, yoga, Olympic weightlifting, woodworking, or any repetitive strain in juicing tasks such as desewer, body weighted wrist stretches. To stretch the wrist flexors, find a table or bench that plays the palm of your hand on top of the table and lean and body weight on them. This should create a slight",

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

Ensure you are relaxed and stable before beginning the stretch. This will help you maintain balance and avoid strain during the exercise.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck**: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest. This action helps to stabilize your neck and prepares the muscles for stretching. It is essential to keep your movements controlled to prevent injury [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 06:39-06:40].\n\n3. **Using a Towel**: If needed, use a towel to assist with the stretch. Wrap it around your neck and hold the ends while gently pulling downwards. This can enhance the stretch by providing additional leverage [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 06:51-06:54].\n\n4. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain the position for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply to help relax the muscles. You may feel a gentle pull along the side of your neck and shoulder blade area.\n\n5. **Reset**: After holding the stretch, relax and",

And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand.

And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fist and kind of push downwards, but again this is to hold that shoulder down to get the best stretch. You don't have to do this part, but it's really going to get a better stretch because then when you go into the stretch your shoulders not going to come up. So this time you really are just going pulling almost your ear towards the shoulder. So you're really just going to go to the side, your hand's going to come up and over and then just gently pull over to the side to get that stretch. So this time you should kind of feel it through here. Some people still do feel it in the the back a little bit, but usually it's right through here.

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

      "answer": "To alleviate neck stiffness using upper trapezius stretches, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit or stand comfortably. Begin by placing one hand behind your head, gently supporting it with your elbow pointing out to the side.\n\n2. **Stretching**: With your other hand, pull down on the elbow of the arm that is behind your head, guiding your head towards the opposite shoulder. This action targets the upper trapezius muscle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds to ensure a good stretch [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 08:32-08:37].\n\n3. **Alternating Sides**: After holding the stretch, switch to the other side and repeat the process. You can alternate between sides or complete all stretches on one side before moving to the other [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 08:32-08:37].\n\n4. **Frequency**: It is recommended to perform these stretches a couple of times a day for optimal results [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 08:32-08:37].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that",

Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on",

This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front.

Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on that and that works really well. You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves.

So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

This technique is particularly effective for individuals experiencing tightness or discomfort due to forward head posture. Start by gently applying pressure with your fingers to the muscles at the base of your skull, using circular motions to help release tension. Focus on areas that feel stiff or painful, as this can significantly alleviate discomfort. It's recommended to incorporate this self-massage into your routine, especially if you frequently experience neck stiffness [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 02:28-02:34].",

You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up",

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too.

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into.

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while",

So I'm gonna stabilize here, go into the chin tuck, and then just get that turn. And I don't know if you heard that at all, but for that, I got a little pop, a little adjustment in my neck. And as long as that's not painful, that's fine. So again, this one just a little bit more continuous movement to get that mobilization in there. So I'm gonna do the other way so you can see it. So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin, and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little paws come back in and relax and reset myself.

So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin, and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little paws come back in and relax and reset myself. So again, you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations. But if you can get it right, you're really gonna get that stiffness out of there. So it works really, really well. So the next one is gonna just be a levator scapula stretch. And that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck.

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using chin tucks and a towel or strap, begin by performing chin tucks, which are effective for addressing neck stiffness. This exercise involves gently tucking your chin towards your chest without bending your neck down. It helps reset the muscles in your neck and can be done anywhere, making it a convenient option for relieving tightness and stiffness [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 01:04-01:05].\n\nFor added support, you can use a towel or strap. Wrap the towel around the back of your head and gently pull forward while performing the chin tuck. This provides additional resistance and helps enhance the stretch of the neck muscles. It's important to maintain a neutral spine and avoid any jerky movements during this exercise.\n\nIn summary, chin tucks combined with a towel or strap can effectively alleviate neck pain by stretching and strengthening the neck muscles. Always proceed with caution, especially if you experience pain, numbness, or tingling radiating into your arms [Video 1: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 03:59-04:00].",

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side.

Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck. And then, yeah, you can give a little over pressure if you'd like along on the jawline. You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful",

You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here.

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using neck rotation, it is essential to incorporate gentle movements rather than avoiding them. When experiencing neck stiffness or pain, many individuals mistakenly believe that limiting movement will aid recovery. However, this approach can exacerbate stiffness and prolong discomfort. Instead, engaging in controlled neck rotations can help restore mobility and reduce pain. \n\nIn the video, it is emphasized that avoiding movement can lead to increased stiffness and persistent pain, which is counterproductive to recovery [Video 3: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 00:41-00:43]. Gentle neck rotations, when performed correctly, can promote flexibility and alleviate discomfort. It is advisable to perform these movements slowly and within a pain-free range to avoid aggravating the condition.\n\nIn summary, incorporating gentle neck rotations is a beneficial strategy for managing neck pain. Rather than avoiding movement, actively engaging in controlled rotations can help alleviate stiffness and improve overall neck function.",

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting. Move side to side for about 20 to 30 reps and repeat it for the five times. Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow stretch. To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest. To stretch the forearm muscles for golfers elbow, you're going to exaggerate a very slow wave so that palm of your hand lands on the table top and bench where your fingers point backwards. Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the",

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting. Move side to side for about 20 to 30 reps and repeat it for the five times. Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow stretch.

To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards.

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

This allows for a clear view of the biceps muscle.\n\n2. **Inspection**: Visually assess the biceps for any asymmetry, swelling, or deformities. The biceps muscle consists of both a long and short head, and it's crucial to observe the overall contour of the muscle [Video 1: t8AU9mWIsqI, Time: 00:39-00:41].\n\n3. **Palpation**: Gently palpate the biceps muscle by placing your fingers on the muscle belly. Start at the midsection of the muscle and move towards the shoulder to feel the tendon of the long head, which runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicipital groove of the humerus. This area is important to examine as it is a common site for irritation and degeneration [Video 1: t8AU9mWIsqI, Time: 00:39-00:41].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure that the",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

If a recent change in ventilator setting has been made, wait approximately 20 to 30 minutes before sampling. that the arterial line is functioning properly. Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10",

Gently advance the needle until you feel a slight give, indicating you have penetrated the artery [Video 1: 71LlfdW548U, Time: 02:53-02:59].\n\n4. **Collecting the Sample**: Once the needle is in the artery, you should see a flashback of blood into the syringe, confirming successful entry.",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event.

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove.

Use your dominant hand to gently withdraw the plunger to fill the syringe with blood [Video 2: 71LlfdW548U, Time: 03:57-04:03].\n\n3. **Needle Insertion**: If you do not see blood, you may have missed the artery. In this case, withdraw the needle slightly and re-align it toward the pulsating artery. Ensure the patient keeps their arm still to prevent dislodging the needle [Video 3: 71LlfdW548U, Time: 03:32-03:37].\n\n4. **Collecting Blood**: Once blood is collected, hold the syringe steady to avoid air aspiration, then withdraw the needle.

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to",

The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right, and I'm going to bend it because what we're going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw backwards.

Avoid using any powder, deodorant, or lotion on your skin prior to the procedure [Video 1: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 02:15-02:19].\n\n2. **Using the Wipes**: Take the CHG (chlorhexidine gluconate) wipes and gently wipe the skin on your arm and shoulder. Make sure to cover the entire area thoroughly to ensure effective cleaning.\n\n3. **Drying**: After applying the wipes, allow the area to air dry for one minute. It is normal for your skin to feel sticky for several minutes after application, but this sensation will dissipate once the skin is fully dry [Video 3: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 04:49-04:50].\n\n4. **Post-application**: Once the area is dry, dress in clean clothes. Discard the used wipes in the trash and do not flush them down the toilet [",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique.

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side.

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down.

This method effectively reduces the skin's temperature and helps clean the affected area. It is crucial to avoid using ice, as it can cause further damage to the injured skin. Additionally, refrain from touching the wound with bare hands or unsterilized materials to prevent infection [Video 1: O1kiguGUt3o, Time: 00:50-00:52].\n\nIn summary, for a first-degree burn, immediately apply cool (not ice) water to the area to alleviate pain and prevent further skin damage. Proper care includes keeping the area clean and avoiding direct contact with unclean surfaces. Following these steps can promote healing and minimize complications associated with burns.",

Confirm that defibrillation is necessary [Video 1].\n\n2. **Prepare the Equipment**: Use multifunction electrode pads or external paddles. Make sure the defibrillator is charged and ready for use.\n\n3. **Position the Paddles**: Place the paddles on the patient's chest. One paddle should be positioned on the right upper chest, and the other on the left lower chest, ensuring good contact with the skin.\n\n4. **Clear the Area**: Before delivering the shock, ensure that everyone is clear of the patient. Announce \"clear\" loudly to prevent accidental contact.\n\n5. **Deliver the Shock**: Press the discharge button on the defibrillator to deliver the shock. Monitor the patient\u2019s rhythm immediately after the shock to assess the effectiveness [Video 1: Dubih8EzBJQ, Time: 00:54-00:59].\n\n6. **Post-Shock Care**: Continue to monitor the patient and be prepared to perform CPR if necessary",

Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to",

So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee.

Ensure your posture is straight to avoid any strain.\n\n2. **Bend One Knee**: Gently bend your right knee and bring your heel towards your buttock. This action engages your quadriceps.\n\n3. **Grab Your Ankle**: With your right hand, reach back to grasp your right ankle. If you find it difficult to maintain balance, you can hold onto a wall or a sturdy object with your left hand for support.\n\n4. **Adjust Position**: If you feel the stretch more in your knee rather than your quadriceps, adjust your leg position by bringing your heel closer to your body. This adjustment helps target the muscle more effectively rather than the knee joint [Video 1: r21kAatSVqc, Time: 04:28-04:32].\n\n5. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for about 15-30 seconds, ensuring you feel a gentle stretch in the front of your thigh.\n\n6. **Switch Sides**: Repeat the same steps with your left leg.\n\n**Safety Note**:",

All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's",

Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better.

Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is find a wine cork. Of course, I prefer the Buffalo TMJ Kick, the click corks, but you could really use any old wine cork for many old wine bottles. What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back",

Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is find a wine cork. Of course, I prefer the Buffalo TMJ Kick, the click corks, but you could really use any old wine cork for many old wine bottles. What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back and forth, side to side, front and back, and just play with it. Let the muscles relax as you're doing this, and play with it as much as you want over the course of a day, as much as your muscles can tolerate. You don't want to push it too hard and you don't want the muscles to get sore. And of course you",

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I",

Ensure it is positioned comfortably without forcing it, as this could exacerbate any existing jaw issues.\n\n3. **Measure the Opening**: Gradually open your mouth to allow the cork to fit. The distance your jaw can open is typically around 22 to 23 millimeters for those with joint problems. This measurement can help determine if there is an acute internal arrangement or articular issue [Video 3].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: It is crucial to avoid any forceful manipulation of the jaw, as this can worsen the condition. If you experience pain or discomfort while measuring, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 01:34-01:37].\n\nBy following these steps, you can safely measure your jaw opening using a cork.",

He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles.

Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable",

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better. In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension. He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then",

Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better. In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension.

This method generates moist heat that penetrates deeper than dry heat, making it more effective for muscle tension relief [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:05-04:08].\n\n2. **Measure Jaw Opening**: Before applying the heat, measure your jaw's opening to establish a baseline. You can use your fingers for measurement, starting with one finger up to the first knuckle and then progressing to two fingers [Video 3: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:31-04:34].\n\n3. **Apply the Heat**: Once heated, place the corn bag on the affected area of your jaw. Ensure it is comfortably warm, not too hot to avoid burns.\n\n4. **Reassess**: After applying the moist heat for a suitable duration, re-measure your jaw opening to see if there\u2019s any improvement in tension and mobility [Video 2: SH-zKg26KCE,",

And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I",

If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable",

But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of",

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is",

In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension. He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings.

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

      "answer": "To measure jaw opening using your fingers, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Measurement**: Start by placing one finger in your mouth, extending it up to the first knuckle. This serves as a baseline measurement for jaw opening. This step helps you gauge the initial range of motion [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:53-04:56].\n\n2. **Progressive Measurement**: Next, use one finger bent at the knuckle to measure further. This will give you an additional reference point for how much your jaw can open. \n\n3. **Maximum Range**: Finally, use two fingers up to the first knuckle. This is considered the maximum reasonable range of motion for most individuals. If you can achieve this, it indicates a healthy jaw opening [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:53-04:56].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: If you suspect your jaw is locked due to an interarticular problem or disc dislocation, it is crucial to avoid any aggressive movements or adjustments. Consulting a healthcare professional is advisable if you experience pain or limited movement [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time",

          "text": "couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's",

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse.

Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is find a wine cork. Of course, I prefer the Buffalo TMJ Kick, the click corks, but you could really use any old wine cork for many old wine bottles. What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back",

Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I",

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is",

And I want you to gently roll it back and forth, side to side, front and back, and just play with it. Let the muscles relax as you're doing this, and play with it as much as you want over the course of a day, as much as your muscles can tolerate. You don't want to push it too hard and you don't want the muscles to get sore. And of course you don't want to overwork or overstrain these compromised joints. Now even though I can't guarantee that this is going to work for you, I can tell you that it is possible and it's safe. I just had a patient last week who I set home with a cork and her jaw unlocked within a few days. The last thing that I want to say is I want to stress to you that even if your jaw unlocks, it's very, very likely that it's going to become locked again. When you clench in your back teeth, you're going to drive the condile behind the disc again and there's a good chance you'll get stuck there.

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive.

      "answer": "To stimulate the vagus nerve and potentially improve mental health, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Practice Deep Breathing**: Engage in deep breathing exercises by inhaling slowly to a count of four, pausing for one to two seconds, and then exhaling to a count of six. This technique promotes relaxation and activates the vagus nerve [Video 1: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 10:33-10:43].\n\n2. **Incorporate Laughter**: Laughter is known to enhance vagal tone. Engaging in activities that make you laugh can stimulate the vagus nerve and improve your mood [Video 2: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 11:13-11:19].\n\n3. **Exercise Regularly**: Physical activity is beneficial for increasing vagal nerve tone. Aim for regular exercise to support overall mental health [Video 3: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 11:37-11:45].\n\n4. **Consider Probiotics**: Taking probiotics can amplify the effects of vagal nerve stimulation. This may be particularly beneficial if you are also practicing deep breathing techniques [Video 3:",

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it. Most of the time, you should be able to get rid of the pain by doing what I've shown you. If not, come in for a visit. The sooner you come in, the easier it is to treat and the faster you get better.

      "answer": "To chant for tinnitus relief, you can follow these steps based on the provided video evidence:\n\n1. **Choose a Comfortable Setting**: Find a quiet and comfortable space where you can focus without distractions. This helps in maximizing the effectiveness of the chanting.\n\n2. **Select a Chant or Mantra**: You can use specific mantras or simply sing. The act of chanting or singing can stimulate the vagus nerve, which may help improve your overall well-being and potentially alleviate tinnitus symptoms [Video 1: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 09:07-09:09].\n\n3. **Practice Regularly**: Incorporate chanting into your daily routine. Consistency is key to experiencing potential benefits. \n\n4. **Combine with Other Techniques**: Consider integrating yoga practices such as the cat-cow pose or sun salutation, which can also stimulate the vagus nerve [Video 1: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 09:19-09:20].\n\n5. **Monitor Your Response**: Pay attention to how your body responds to chanting. If you notice any discomfort or worsening of symptoms, it may be wise to consult a healthcare professional.\n\nRemember, while chanting may help",

Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully.

I'll hold it longer than they recommend and you said to you I hold a less than 7 seconds and this one you find the one that works for you again three seconds in hold three seconds out hold that real simple to do next one is four seven eight yeah this is my favorite this is the one I'll use at night sometimes or in the car in this one you breathe in for four hold for seven which is quite a good",

A pig flow meter is easy to use, even children as young as four should be able to perform a pig flow with good results. Let's take a look at how it's done. Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that you do diaphragmatic breathing and that's basically belly breathing. So instead of when you breathe in, you're not trying to expand your chest, you're trying to expand the diaphragm, which is in the belly. Right. So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that. And then you, a lot of times, they recommend perspreading, which is your blowing, it's like you're blowing out a candle. In some instances, they even say take your tongue and put it between the teeth and the front gums. And there's different eyes of the tongue right behind the, on the roof of",

To practice box breathing, visualize a box and follow these steps: inhale deeply through your nose for a set duration, hold your breath for the same duration, exhale slowly through your mouth for that same duration, and then hold your breath again for the same length of time before repeating the cycle. You can choose the length of time based on your comfort level, typically starting with 4-5 seconds for each phase.\n\nThis technique is utilized by special forces in the armed services to manage anxiety levels before high-stress situations, such as missions, highlighting its effectiveness in promoting calmness and mental clarity [Video 1: 2oXoiQfija4, Time: 04:25-04:31]. \n\nIn summary, box breathing is a simple yet effective method for controlling stress and enhancing concentration by regulating breath patterns. It involves equal durations for inhalation, breath-holding, exhalation, and another breath-hold, making it a practical tool for anyone looking to improve their mental state.",

The third one, which by the way seems to fit with the name, I guess you'd call it third breathing. Sure. So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right.

And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that you do diaphragmatic breathing and that's basically belly breathing. So instead of when you breathe in, you're not trying to expand your chest, you're trying to expand the diaphragm, which is in the belly. Right. So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that. And then you, a lot of times, they recommend perspreading, which is your blowing, it's like you're blowing out a candle. In some instances, they even say take your tongue and put it between the teeth and the front gums. And there's different eyes of the tongue right behind the, on the roof of",

It takes me some. The third one, which by the way seems to fit with the name, I guess you'd call it third breathing. Sure. So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right. And you want to need to find out which one of these works best for you. And maybe or even a little variation of one of these. But pick the time about what length you want to go. I can't recommend this enough red. I mean, it's just people get anxiety attacks and stuff like that. It's always the shallow breathing on them that you can see. All right, thanks. Good luck with it.

Next, hold your breath for a count of seven seconds. Finally, exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of eight seconds. This technique is designed to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety by regulating your breathing pattern and enhancing oxygen flow to your body.\n\nThe four, seven, eight method is particularly effective as it encourages mindfulness and focus on your breath, which can significantly lower stress levels. As mentioned, this exercise can be practiced in various settings, such as at home or even in your car when feeling stressed [Video 1: 2oXoiQfija4, Time: 05:20-05:23]. \n\nIn summary, the four, seven, eight breathing exercise is a simple yet powerful tool for managing anxiety. By incorporating this technique into your daily routine, you may find it easier to achieve a state of calm and relaxation.",

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what",

This is actually used by a lot of the arm services special forces or you can imagine Brad how important is for them to keep their anxiety levels down. They're in the plane ready to go on a mission. Sure. So it's called box breathing. So you can picture a box and you're going to pick the length of time. Like you can do anywhere from like three seconds all the way up to nine seconds for each side of the box. Right. So you're going to breathe in, inhale, let's take three seconds. Okay. And you do it, Brad. Okay. I'm going to be talking. Inhale for three seconds, hold for three seconds, one, two, three, exhale for three seconds, and then hold one more time for three seconds. There you go. Start it again. And then start it again. And you decide what length works for you. Brad and I were just discussing this. The next one's called 478. I always do a little variation of that. I'll hold it longer than they recommend and you said to you I hold a less than 7 seconds and",

So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right. And you want to need to find out which one of these works best for you. And maybe or even a little variation of one of these. But pick the time about what length you want to go. I can't recommend this enough red. I mean, it's just people get anxiety attacks and stuff like that. It's always the shallow breathing on them that you can see. All right, thanks. Good luck with it.

If you draw a line through this mole shown here, the two halves will not match, meaning it is asymmetrical, a warning sign for melanoma. B stands for border irregularity. A benign mole generally has smooth and even borders as shown here. The borders of a melanoma, as shown here, may be uneven with scalloped, notched, or trailing edges. C stands for color variation. Most benign moles have one or two evenly distributed colors. Having a variety of colors, including brown, black, white, red, and or blue may be a feature of melanoma. D stands for diameter greater than half a centimeter. Although melanomas may be larger and diameter than the eraser head on your pencil, they may sometimes be smaller when first detected. The last letter E stands for evolution. In most cases, benign moles are stable over time. time. Be on alert when a mole starts to evolve or change in any way. When a mole is evolving, see a doctor. Any change in size, shape, color, texture, elevation, or any new symptom, such as bleeding, itching or scabbing, maybe a sign of malignancy. Thanks for watching!",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

      "answer": "To detect signs of skin cancer, particularly melanoma, you can follow the ABCDE method:\n\n1. **Asymmetry**: Check if the mole is symmetrical. A benign mole will have both halves that match when a line is drawn through the middle. If the two sides do not match, this asymmetry is a warning sign for melanoma [Video 1: hXYd0WRhzN4, Time: 01:03-01:08].\n\n2. **Border**: Examine the borders of the mole. Benign moles typically have smooth, even borders, while cancerous moles may have irregular, notched, or scalloped edges. \n\n3. **Color**: Look for variations in color. A mole with multiple colors (brown, black, tan, red, white, or blue) can indicate potential malignancy.\n\n4. **Diameter**: Monitor the size of the mole. Moles larger than 6mm (about the size of a pencil eraser) should be evaluated by a healthcare professional.\n\n5. **Evolving**: Pay attention to any changes in the mole over time, including size, shape, color, or elevation.\n\nIf you notice any of these signs, it is crucial to",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back",

But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down.

Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling.

For this exercise, you should be on your left side if working on your right shoulder. Your right elbow should be bent at a 90-degree angle, resting against your side [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:15-05:20].\n\n2. **Weight Setup**: Hold a light dumbbell in your right hand, keeping the weight down in front of you. This positioning allows for effective movement against gravity [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:15-05:20].\n\n3. **Execution**: Rotate your right arm upward towards the ceiling while keeping your elbow tucked into your side. This motion is crucial as it targets the rotator cuff muscles effectively [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Perform this exercise for a set number of repetitions, ensuring that you maintain control throughout the movement.\n\n**Safety Note**:",

I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back",

And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their",

Attach a handle to the cable.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Hold the handle with the arm closest to the machine. Keep your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle and close to your side. This position is crucial as it stabilizes your shoulder during the exercise [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:27-04:34].\n\n3. **Execution**: Rotate your forearm away from your body while keeping your elbow fixed at your side. This motion should be controlled and deliberate, focusing on the external rotation of the shoulder [Video 2: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48].\n\n4. **Resistance**: Ensure that the cable provides adequate resistance without compromising form. The resistance should come from the cable pulling straight down, allowing you to focus on the rotation against this force [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Perform 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions, ensuring that you maintain",
