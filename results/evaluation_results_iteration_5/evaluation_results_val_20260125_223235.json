          "text": "I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for part few health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the blade. Stop the blade is very simple. Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Apply an over-the-counter antibiotic or a burn ointment. Leave the burn alone for 24 hours. Don't cover the burn and less clothing robes on it. If it shrubs, cover it with a gauze pad tape twell away from the burn. Move the dressing every day and clean the wound, cover it again. If the irritation and pain does not subside, do not hesitate to seek for medical help.",

Just put the turnicant on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super, super tight. Then we're going to take the handle. We're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it. And we're going to write the time.

      "answer": "To apply pressure on a wound effectively, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess the Situation**: If you encounter a patient with a bleeding wound, your first action is to apply direct pressure to the area. This is crucial for controlling the bleeding.\n\n2. **Apply Pressure**: Use the palm of your hand to cover the wound completely. If the wound is large, apply your entire palm and body weight onto it. This firm pressure is essential to help stop the bleeding. Maintain this pressure continuously until medical help arrives [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38; 00:54-01:01].\n\n3. **Monitor the Patient**: While applying pressure, keep an eye on the patient\u2019s condition. If the bleeding does not stop, you may need to consider additional steps, such as wound packing or using a tourniquet, but these should only be done if necessary and if you are trained to do so.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you do not remove any objects that may be embedded in the wound, as this can worsen the bleeding. Always prioritize calling for emergency medical assistance while providing care [Video 1].",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

It is easy to go straight through the radial artery if you rush, you may feel a slight give as the needle penetrates the wall of the radial artery. Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe. If you don't see blood, you have missed the artery and will have to withdraw the needle somewhat and then re-aign the syringe toward the pulsating artery. Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure. Place the syringe onto the ice, pack ice cubes over the syringe, and send it off to the lab right away, arterial blood gas or ABG samples should be analyzed within 10 minutes of collection for accurate results.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

This is crucial to help stop the bleeding. Maintain this pressure until help arrives or the bleeding stops [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38; 00:54-01:01].\n\n2. **Prepare the Gauze**: If the bleeding continues despite applying pressure, you will need to pack the wound with gauze. You can use hemostatic gauze, standard gauze, or even a clean piece of clothing if gauze is unavailable [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 01:12-01:17].\n\n3. **Pack the Wound**: Take the gauze and begin to pack it into the wound. Continue to push the gauze inside until you cannot pack it any further. This step is essential to reach the source of the bleeding and help control it effectively [Video 1].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always ensure that your hands are clean or wear gloves if available to minimize the risk of infection.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results.

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms hang down, the wrists should come up even with the handles here. Right, so if they're like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well. And these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other right. But first, how do we make sure that the height is right down there? That's good point. Let's make sure",

Yes, which you're going to find out how useful this can be for after surgery as well as before surgery. So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant. Just put the turnicant on. We're going to tighten it as much as possible. It's Velcro. So super, super tight. Then we're going to take the handle. We're going to twist it until the bleeding source is stopped. And then we're going to place it into the handle. We're going to take the Velcro and close it. And we're going to write the time.

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

It is easy to go straight through the radial artery if you rush, you may feel a slight give as the needle penetrates the wall of the radial artery. Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe. If you don't see blood, you have missed the artery and will have to withdraw the needle somewhat and then re-aign the syringe toward the pulsating artery. Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure.

          "text": "Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video.

Use the palm of your hand and apply your full weight to stop the bleeding. Maintain this pressure until help arrives or the bleeding stops [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38; 00:54-01:01].\n\n2. **Wound Packing**: If applying pressure does not stop the bleeding, the next step is to pack the wound with gauze. You can use hemostatic gauze, regular gauze, or even a shirt if no gauze is available. Take the gauze and pack it firmly into the wound until you cannot pack it any further. This helps to control the bleeding by applying pressure directly to the source [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 01:12-01:17].\n\n3. **Monitor and Maintain**: After packing the wound, continue to monitor the patient and maintain pressure. If bleeding persists, consider additional measures such as applying a tourniquet if necessary.\n\nAlways ensure that you are using clean materials to minimize the risk of infection",

And as you exhale, start rolling forward so that you're drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Just notice that soreness, gosh, wow, we carry so much in that region, don't we? let's take it now to the rear. And so to the front and to the back you do it maybe about 30 to 45 seconds. Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully. And again, inhale up, exhale it down, just one more, inhale up, exhale it out.

So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my",

You don't have to, you can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate back and forth, give the muscle a little time to relax and reset. And then the last one is going to be an upper trap stretch, which is the big muscle over all of those. And that's another one that holds a lot of stress and tightness and stiffness. And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fist and kind of push downwards, but again this is to hold that shoulder down to get the best stretch. You don't have to do this part, but it's really going to get a better stretch because then when you go into the stretch your shoulders not going to come up.

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

Ensure your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed. This posture is crucial to effectively relieve tension [Video 1: CvW-Zq3NlkU, Time: 00:27-00:33].\n\n2. **Shoulder Rolls**: Bring your fingertips to your shoulders. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, start rolling your shoulders forward. Imagine drawing invisible circles with your elbows. This motion helps to release built-up tension in the shoulder area [Video 1: CvW-Zq3NlkU, Time: 00:27-00:33].\n\n3. **Stretching**: Consider incorporating a levator scapula stretch. This targets the muscles around the shoulder blade and neck, which often hold significant stress. Gently tilt your head to one side while applying light pressure with your hand to enhance the stretch [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 06:51-06:54].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you perform these movements gently to avoid straining your muscles.

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide.

So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented.

On the start of your operating day in the morning, your first patient is in the operating room eight and it comes with the 10 to 15 minutes delay. As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay.

This can be achieved using a bear hugger or forced air warming devices, or by applying warm compresses to the extremities. Warming helps to dilate the veins, making them more prominent and easier to access [Video 2: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 03:47-03:52].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Ensure the patient is in a comfortable position. Elevating the arm may also help to engorge the veins.\n\n3. **Hydration**: If possible, ensure the patient is well-hydrated, as dehydration can lead to smaller veins.\n\n4. **Reverse Smark Technique**: For particularly difficult cases, consider using the reverse Smark technique, which is designed to facilitate finding IV access even in challenging scenarios [Video 1: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 05:01-05:06].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always assess the patient's condition before proceeding with venipunct",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins.

Assess the veins visually and palpate to identify the best site for venous access.\n\n3. **Application of the Reverse Esmarch**: Use a bandage or elastic wrap to apply gentle pressure around the limb, starting from the distal end and moving proximally. This technique helps to engorge the veins, making them more prominent and easier to locate [Video 1: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 05:01-05:06].\n\n4. **Accessing the Vein**: Once the veins are engorged, proceed with the venipuncture or cannulation using standard sterile techniques.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Monitor the patient for any signs",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right, and I'm going to bend it because what we're going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw backwards. So this is the first part. I'm going to take my right hand, I'm going to place on the opposite side of the door frame and I'm going to pull into my body weight, I should say,",

So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands or I should say your arms. And you're going to, again, put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame. Just like this. Put your feet together. And then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. So with this, it should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those peck muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region. Those are the rhomboids where the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by",

And as you exhale, start rolling forward so that you're drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Just notice that soreness, gosh, wow, we carry so much in that region, don't we? let's take it now to the rear. And so to the front and to the back you do it maybe about 30 to 45 seconds. Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully. And again, inhale up, exhale it down, just one more, inhale up, exhale it out.

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands or I should say your arms. And you're going to, again, put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame. Just like this. Put your feet together. And then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. So with this, it should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those peck muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region. Those are the rhomboids where the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by",

Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully.

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

      "answer": "To reset forward rounded shoulders using a doorframe, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find a Doorframe**: Stand in a doorway where you can comfortably lean into the frame. This will provide the support needed for the exercise.\n\n2. **Position Your Arms**: Place your forearms on the doorframe at shoulder height, with your elbows bent at 90 degrees. This positioning helps to engage the right muscles effectively.\n\n3. **Lean Forward**: Gently lean your body weight into the doorframe. This action will create a stretch across your chest and shoulders, promoting better alignment and reducing tension in the shoulder capsule [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 01:08-01:13].\n\n4. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for about 15-30 seconds, allowing your shoulders to relax and feel the stretch. This helps to reset the shoulders back to a more neutral position.\n\n5. **Repeat as Necessary**: You can repeat this exercise several times throughout the day to help alleviate muscle tension and improve posture.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience any pain or discomfort during this exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional [Video 1: tr7JKUx",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you",

Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to",

So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down.",

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time.

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair. But just lift your heels up off the ground and then slowly come back down. So now",

      "answer": "To improve blood flow and treat varicose veins by raising your legs, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Lie down on your back on a flat surface. Elevate your legs above the level of your heart. You can use pillows or a wedge to support your legs. This position helps to utilize gravity to facilitate venous return, reducing pressure in the veins.\n\n2. **Leg Exercises**: While your legs are elevated, perform gentle leg exercises. A simple method is to do straight leg raises. Pull your toes towards you and hold the position at the top for a few seconds. This action engages the muscles in your legs, which can aid in pushing blood back towards the heart [Video 3: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n3. **Duration**: Aim to keep your legs elevated for 15-30 minutes several times a day, especially after prolonged periods of standing or sitting.\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure that you are comfortable and not straining your back or legs. If you experience any discomfort, adjust your position or consult a healthcare professional.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help improve blood flow and alleviate symptoms associated",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it. Most of the time, you should be able to get rid of the pain by doing what I've shown you. If not, come in for a visit. The sooner you come in, the easier it is to treat and the faster you get better.

And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down.",

You can prop one leg up for better support, which helps in maintaining the correct posture during the exercise [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n2. **Leg Movement**: Begin the bicycle leg exercise by lifting one leg off the ground. Straighten it out while pulling your toes towards you. This action engages the muscles in your leg, which is essential for promoting venous return [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n3. **Hold Position**: At the top of the leg raise, hold the position briefly. This hold encourages blood to flow back down through the veins, utilizing gravity to assist in venous return [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat this exercise for several cycles, alternating legs. This will help strengthen the muscles and improve circulation.\n\n**Safety",

So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair. But just lift your heels up off the ground and then slowly come back down. So now you're working those calf muscles like a pump. So they're being a natural pump to work that fluid and blood back out of the legs. So just up, woo! That's why you need something to hold onto. Up and slowly back down.

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go.

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins.

Start with 10 repetitions, holding each raise for 5 to 10 seconds to allow blood to flow back down [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 02:06-02:12].\n\n3. **Progression**: As you become comfortable, gradually increase the number of repetitions to 15, 20, or even 25. This progressive overload helps strengthen the calf muscles, which can enhance venous return [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 02:06-02:12].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure you perform these exercises slowly and with control to avoid strain.

Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity",

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also",

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down.",

So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for",

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel to help stretch your neck and get that stiffness and tightness out. This is called Snacks. It's a particular technique. It stands for something really long. But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning, then I'm getting that extra stretch in there",

When you're mobilizing things, you really need to make sure that you don't have something where you shouldn't be mobilizing that spine. So if it hurts in any way, hold off and check in with your doctor or your physical therapist. So the next one that you can do is same kind of motion with the chin touch that said now you're just going to do some turns with it. So this time it's not necessarily the up and over like this nags, but you're just going to do that same kind of motion where you're tucking in the chin. Now this time I'm stabilizing with this side and then I'm just going to help do the stretch and overwhelm doing that chin touch. So I'm gonna stabilize here, go into the chin tuck, and then just get that turn. And I don't know if you heard that at all, but for that, I got a little pop, a little adjustment in my neck. And as long as that's not painful, that's fine. So again, this one just a little bit more continuous movement to get that mobilization in there. So I'm gonna do the",

      "answer": "To perform chin tucks effectively for neck stiffness, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by sitting or standing comfortably with your back straight. Ensure your shoulders are relaxed.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck Movement**: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest. It's important to note that this is not about bending your head down; instead, think of moving your head straight back, creating a double chin effect. This motion helps to realign the neck and reset the muscles [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 01:04-01:05].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for a few seconds, ensuring you feel a gentle stretch without pain. \n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat the chin tuck exercise several times throughout the day, especially if you experience tightness or stiffness in your neck.\n\n**Safety Considerations**: Avoid forcing your neck into an uncomfortable position. If you feel any sharp pain or discomfort, stop the exercise immediately. Always consult with a healthcare provider if you have ongoing neck issues or concerns before starting any new exercise regimen [Video 1].",

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while",

This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into. So I'm doing like that to get that segment stabilized and and then I'm tucking in my chin and going back into extension. So you can see it's that combination moves sometimes it's hard to get down. This one you don't have to hold as long. You can just do it a smooth continuous motion, but if you wanna hold the movement for a little bit, you can hold that three to five.

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

So that holds the vertebrae there so you can get the stretch a little bit higher. Then you're going to grab the other hand, make sure you're not choking yourself, but bring it up up and over your ear. So this time you're gonna kind of pull up and over. So you're not just pulling a cross. That's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull. So I'm pulling down with this hand and up and across with this hand. So I'm getting a nice, good stretch in there. And so this one sends us a full stretch. I'm gonna hold it for 30 seconds.

      "answer": "To alleviate neck stiffness using a towel, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Towel**: Take a towel and roll it up to create a cylindrical shape that can be used for support.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Place the towel around your neck, ensuring it is positioned just above your shoulders, not directly on your neck. This helps to stabilize your cervical spine while performing movements [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:27-03:29].\n\n3. **Chin Tucks**: Begin with chin tucks. Tuck your chin down towards your chest while maintaining the towel's support. This action helps to engage the neck muscles and improve posture [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:39-03:41].\n\n4. **Stretching**: After performing chin tucks, you can stretch your neck by gently pulling the towel down while tilting your head to the side. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds on each side. Aim to do this three times on each side for optimal results [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:27-03:29",

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself.

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into.

So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into. So I'm doing like that to get that segment stabilized and and then I'm tucking in my chin and going back into extension. So you can see it's that combination moves sometimes it's hard to get down. This one you don't have to hold as long. You can just do it a smooth continuous motion, but if you wanna hold the movement for a little bit, you can hold that three to five.

This will be used to support your neck during the exercise [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Sit or stand comfortably, ensuring your back is straight. Place the rolled towel behind your neck, allowing it to rest comfortably against the base of your skull.\n\n3. **Perform the Extension**: Gently tilt your head back, allowing your neck to extend over the towel. Ensure that you are not straining your neck; the movement should be smooth and controlled [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:27-03:29].\n\n4. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for about 30 seconds. You can repeat this exercise two to three times on each side, depending on your comfort level. If you experience any pain or discomfort, stop the exercise immediately [Video 3: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n5. **Safety Consider",

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it.

You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well, you convinced me more that actually works almost better pulling down Brad for the majority of people, but I have had some people that works this way.

So again, kind of up where your ear is, not on your neck, but up and over and then pulling down with this one and up and over with that one. Again, holding that stretch for 30 seconds and then doing it three on each side. If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by",

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics.

Ensure it is positioned at the base of your skull, not directly on your neck.\n\n3. **Perform Neck Turns**: Gently turn your head to one side while keeping the towel in place. This action should be slow and controlled. Hold the stretch for about 30 seconds. Repeat this on the opposite side [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:27-03:29].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim to perform this stretch three times on each side for optimal results.

So the next one is gonna just be a levator scapula stretch. And that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the",

Little paws come back in and relax and reset myself. So again, you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations. But if you can get it right, you're really gonna get that stiffness out of there. So it works really, really well. So the next one is gonna just be a levator scapula stretch. And that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward",

So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my",

So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down here and remember be safe don't follow over when you're stretching, how fun and how we feel that are seen.",

This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury. Or another one, such as a couple tunnels in drone, passive, risk flexion and extension. To stretch through risk flexors, point your fingers up in your elbows, extend it nice and straight. Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors. Make sure your arm is nice and straight and your elbow is locked out. This is a great way to mobilize and stretch the wrist for any wrist demanding movement tasks. For example, gymnastics, yoga, Olympic weightlifting, woodworking, or any repetitive strain in juicing tasks such as desewer, body weighted wrist stretches. To stretch the wrist flexors, find a table or bench that plays the palm of your hand on top of the table and lean and body weight on them. This should create a slight",

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

Ensure your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck**: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest. This helps to stabilize your neck and prepare for the stretch [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 06:39-06:40].\n\n3. **Use a Towel**: Take a towel and place it behind your neck. Hold the ends of the towel with both hands. This will assist in achieving the correct angle for the stretch.\n\n4. **Gentle Turn**: While maintaining the chin tuck, use the towel to help you gently turn your head to one side. This action targets the levator scapula muscles, which extend from the shoulder blade up into the neck [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 06:51-06:54].\n\n5. **Hold and Relax**: Maintain this position for a few seconds, then relax and reset your neck position.

And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand.

And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fist and kind of push downwards, but again this is to hold that shoulder down to get the best stretch. You don't have to do this part, but it's really going to get a better stretch because then when you go into the stretch your shoulders not going to come up. So this time you really are just going pulling almost your ear towards the shoulder. So you're really just going to go to the side, your hand's going to come up and over and then just gently pull over to the side to get that stretch. So this time you should kind of feel it through here. Some people still do feel it in the the back a little bit, but usually it's right through here.

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

      "answer": "To alleviate neck stiffness through upper trapezius stretches, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit or stand comfortably. Use one hand to support your head by placing your hand behind your head, with your elbow bent.\n\n2. **Stretching**: Gently pull your head down towards the opposite side. For example, if you're stretching the right upper trapezius, pull your head down towards your left shoulder. This action helps elongate the muscle and relieve tension. Hold this position for about 30 seconds to ensure a good stretch [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 08:32-08:37].\n\n3. **Alternating Sides**: After holding the stretch, switch to the other side and repeat the process. You can alternate back and forth between sides or choose to stretch one side at a time [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 08:32-08:37].\n\n4. **Frequency**: Perform these stretches a couple of times a day for optimal results [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 08:32-08:37].\n\n**Safety Note**:",

Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on",

It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on that and that works really well. You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take",

And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain and tension at the area where the neck meets the skull, you can perform a simple self-massage. This technique is particularly effective for individuals experiencing tightness due to forward head posture, which often leads to pain in that region. Begin by gently kneading the muscles at the base of the skull using your fingers, applying moderate pressure. Focus on any areas that feel particularly stiff or tender. This self-massage can help alleviate discomfort and improve mobility in the neck. It is recommended to incorporate this technique as part of a broader exercise routine targeting neck stiffness and pain [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 02:28-02:34].",

You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up",

This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel",

You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too.

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into.

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while",

So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin, and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little paws come back in and relax and reset myself.

So it works really, really well. So the next one is gonna just be a levator scapula stretch. And that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck.

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using chin tucks and a towel or strap, start by performing chin tucks, which are effective for addressing neck stiffness. This exercise involves gently tucking your chin towards your chest, which helps to reset the muscles in your neck and alleviate tightness. Chin tucks can be done anywhere, making them a convenient option for daily relief [Video 2].\n\nTo enhance the effectiveness of chin tucks, you can use a towel or strap. Place the towel or strap around the back of your head, holding both ends in front of you. As you perform the chin tuck, gently pull on the towel or strap to provide additional resistance, which can help deepen the stretch and promote better alignment of the cervical spine. This method can be particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing stiffness or discomfort in the neck area.\n\nIn summary, incorporating chin tucks with a towel or strap can effectively relieve neck pain by resetting muscle tension and improving spinal alignment [Video 2].",

Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck. And then, yeah, you can give a little over pressure if you'd like along on the jawline. You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful",

You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using neck rotation, it is essential to engage in gentle movements rather than avoiding them. A common misconception is that keeping the neck still will alleviate pain; however, this can lead to increased stiffness and prolonged discomfort. Instead, incorporating neck rotation exercises can help restore mobility and reduce pain. \n\nFor instance, when experiencing a \"trick\" neck, it is crucial to avoid immobilization. Instead, gently rotating the neck can help alleviate stiffness and improve range of motion. The act of moving the neck, even if it initially causes discomfort, is vital for recovery and can prevent further complications associated with immobility [Video 3: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 00:41-00:43]. \n\nIn summary, to relieve neck pain, incorporate gentle neck rotation exercises into your routine. This approach can help mitigate stiffness and promote healing, counteracting the tendency to avoid movement which can exacerbate the condition.",

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down.

It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle.

My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down.

To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest.

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

This position allows for better visibility and access to the biceps.\n\n2. **Visual Inspection**: Observe the biceps muscle for any asymmetry, swelling, or deformities. The biceps consists of both a long and short head, which should be noted during inspection [Video 1: t8AU9mWIsqI, Time: 00:39-00:41].\n\n3. **Palpation**: Gently palpate the biceps muscle by placing your fingers on the muscle belly. Start at the distal end near the elbow and move upwards towards the shoulder. Pay particular attention to the tendon of the long head, which runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicipital groove of the humerus. This tendon is crucial to examine as it is a common site for irritation and degeneration [Video 1].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure that the patient is comfortable and relaxed to avoid any muscle tension that could hinder palpation.

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

This helps prevent any skin irritation.\n\n3. **Wrap the Ice Pack**: Always wrap the ice pack or frozen peas in a thin cloth or towel. This prevents direct contact with the skin, which can cause frostbite.\n\n4. **Apply the Ice Pack**: Place the wrapped ice pack on the affected area. It\u2019s important to apply it gently without excessive pressure.\n\n5. **Timing**: Keep the ice pack on the injury for about 15-20 minutes. This duration is effective for reducing swelling and numbing pain.\n\n6. **Rest and Monitor**: After removing the ice pack, allow the skin to return to normal temperature before reapplying. Monitor for any adverse reactions, such as increased pain or skin irritation.\n\nRemember, if you experience any discomfort or",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

If a recent change in ventilator setting has been made, wait approximately 20 to 30 minutes before sampling. that the arterial line is functioning properly. Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

Arteries are easier to locate due to their pulsation and they do not roll like veins [Video 1: 71LlfdW548U, Time: 01:01-01:08].\n\n3. **Needle Insertion**: Using a sterile needle, gently advance it into the soft tissue where you believe the radial artery is located. Be cautious not to rush, as this may cause you to go straight through the artery. You may feel a slight give when the needle penetrates the artery [Video 1: 71LlfdW548U, Time: 02:53-02:59].\n\n4. **Collecting the Sample**: Once the needle is correctly positioned in the artery",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event.

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove.

Ensure you have gloves and other items ready for use.\n\n2. **Stabilizing the Syringe**: With your non-dominant hand, stabilize the syringe. With your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger to fill the syringe with blood. It\u2019s crucial to hold the syringe steady to prevent air from entering [Video 2: 71LlfdW548U, Time: 03:57-04:03].\n\n3. **Needle Insertion**: If you do not see blood upon insertion, you may have missed the vein.

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully.

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein,",

It's important to avoid using any powders, deodorants, or lotions prior to the application, as these can interfere with the effectiveness of the wipes [Video 2: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 02:15-02:19].\n\n2. **Application**: Start with the neck area. Use one wipe to clean the skin, beginning at the base of your neck and moving downward towards the chest. Make sure to cover the entire area thoroughly, ensuring you wipe in a circular motion to remove any dry skin effectively.\n\n3. **Coverage**: After the neck, continue to the chest area. Use the same wipe to clean from the collarbone down to the sternum, ensuring you cover the entire circumference of the chest [Video 3: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 04:16-04:20].\n\n4. **Post-application**: Do not rinse your skin after using the wipes, as this can diminish their antibacterial properties [Video 3]. \n\n5",

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to",

The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right, and I'm going to bend it because what we're going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw backwards.

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique.

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side.

Ensure that you cover the entire area thoroughly, including the sides of your back [Video 3: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 04:16-04:20].\n\n3. **Drying**: After applying the wipe, allow the area to air dry for about one minute. It is normal for your skin to feel sticky for several minutes, but this sensation will dissipate as your skin dries [Video 2: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 04:49-04:50].\n\n4. **Post-application**: Once your skin",

You may also want to clean the area around your nose with antiseptic wipes to reduce the risk of contamination [Video 1: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 04:49-04:50].\n\n2. **Application Schedule**: Mupirocin should be applied twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening, for a total of five days. If you are scheduled for surgery, apply it once more on the morning of the procedure [Video 2: 5GO18A5-ZtQ, Time: 05:40-05:44].\n\n3. **How to Apply**: Squeeze a small amount of mupirocin ointment onto a clean fingertip or cotton swab. Gently insert the swab into your nostril and apply the ointment to the inside of the nostril. Repeat for the other nostril.\n\n4. **Post-Application Care**: After applying the ointment, wash your hands thoroughly to prevent spreading the bacteria [",

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from",

      "answer": "To treat a first-degree (mild) burn, the immediate and most effective action is to cool the burn area with cold water, but not ice. Cold water helps to reduce the skin's temperature and assists in cleaning the affected area, which is crucial for preventing further damage. It is important to avoid using ice, as it can exacerbate the injury by causing additional skin damage. Additionally, refrain from touching the wound with bare hands or unsterilized objects to minimize the risk of infection [Video 1: O1kiguGUt3o, Time: 00:50-00:52].\n\nIn summary, for first-degree burns, apply cool (not ice) water to the affected area to alleviate pain and prevent further injury. This method is simple yet effective for managing minor burns, ensuring proper care and promoting healing. Always remember to keep the area clean and avoid direct contact with the burn to reduce the risk of complications.",

      "answer": "To perform manual defibrillation using external paddles, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess the Patient**: Ensure that the patient is in a state of cardiac arrest and requires defibrillation. Confirm the rhythm is shockable, such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\n2. **Prepare the Equipment**: Gather the external paddles and ensure they are connected to the defibrillator. Make sure the device is charged and ready for use.\n\n3. **Position the Paddles**: Place one paddle on the right side of the patient's chest, just below the clavicle, and the other paddle on the left side, at the apex of the heart, typically in the mid-axillary line.\n\n4. **Clear the Area**: Before delivering the shock, ensure that everyone is clear of the patient to avoid accidental injury. Announce \"clear\" loudly.\n\n5. **Deliver the Shock**: Press the discharge button on the defibrillator to deliver the shock. Monitor the patient\u2019s response and rhythm after the shock.\n\n6. **Continue CPR**: If necessary, resume CPR immediately after defibrillation to maximize the chances of restoring a normal heart rhythm [Video 1: Dubih",

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

For example, gymnastics, yoga, Olympic weightlifting, woodworking, or any repetitive strain in juicing tasks such as desewer, body weighted wrist stretches. To stretch the wrist flexors, find a table or bench that plays the palm of your hand on top of the table and lean and body weight on them. This should create a slight stretch already. If you still don't feel the stretch, slightly lean forward with your body weight until you feel a slight stretch, the back of your wrist or in the inner portion of your forearm. Now if you don't feel any pain or severe pain, you are now ready to lean side to side. Nice and slow. This will mobilize the wrist and wrist extension and also stretch out the wrist flex muscle. To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee.

Ensure you have a stable surface nearby for support if needed.\n\n2. **Bend One Knee**: Gently bend one knee, bringing your heel towards your buttock. This action engages the quadriceps muscle at the front of your thigh.\n\n3. **Grab Your Ankle**: With the same-side hand, reach back to grasp your ankle or foot. If you cannot reach your ankle, do not force it; only go as far as comfortable to avoid strain.\n\n4. **Align Your Hips**: Ensure your hips are aligned and facing forward. If you feel the stretch more in your knee rather than the muscle belly, adjust by bringing your leg back slightly [Video 1: r21kAatSVqc, Time: 04:28-04:32].\n\n5. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for 15-30 seconds, feeling the stretch in the front of your thigh.

          "text": "it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better.

It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's",

Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is find a wine cork. Of course, I prefer the Buffalo TMJ Kick, the click corks, but you could really use any old wine cork for many old wine bottles. What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back",

Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is find a wine cork. Of course, I prefer the Buffalo TMJ Kick, the click corks, but you could really use any old wine cork for many old wine bottles. What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back and forth, side to side, front and back, and just play with it. Let the muscles relax as you're doing this, and play with it as much as you want over the course of a day, as much as your muscles can tolerate. You don't want to push it too hard and you don't want the muscles to get sore. And of course you",

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I",

      "answer": "To measure jaw opening using a cork, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Obtain a Cork**: Use a cork, such as the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork, which is specifically designed for this purpose [Video 3: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 02:23-02:26].\n\n2. **Position the Cork**: Place the cork between your teeth. Ensure that it is positioned comfortably and securely without causing pain.\n\n3. **Measure the Opening**: Gradually open your mouth while keeping the cork in place. The distance between your upper and lower teeth will indicate how far your jaw can open. Typically, a normal maximum opening is around 22 to 23 millimeters, which can help identify if there is a joint problem [Video 3].\n\n4. **Assess the Results**: If your jaw opening is significantly less than this range, it may suggest an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem.\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid forcing your jaw open or using excessive pressure, as this can exacerbate any existing issues. If you experience pain or discomfort, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional [Video 1].",

He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings.

Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable",

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension. He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then",

Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better. In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension.

All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of",

Place the corn bag in the microwave for about 1.5 to 2 minutes. This duration allows the bag to generate moist heat, which is more effective at penetrating and relieving muscle tension compared to dry heat [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:05-04:08].\n\n2. **Measure Jaw Opening**: Before applying the heat, measure your jaw's opening to establish a baseline. Use your fingers to gauge the distance, starting from one finger up to the first knuckle, then one bent knuckle, and finally two fingers [Video 3: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:31-04:34].\n\n3. **Apply the Heat**: Once the corn bag is heated, carefully place it around the jaw area. Ensure it is not too hot to avoid burns. If it feels too hot, allow it to cool slightly before application.\n\n4. **Reassess Jaw Opening**: After applying the moist heat for a suitable duration, measure your jaw",

Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I",

If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable",

It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's",

If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem.

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is",

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

      "answer": "To measure jaw opening using fingers, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Measurement**: Start by placing one finger in the mouth, measuring up to the first knuckle. This provides a baseline measurement of jaw opening. \n\n2. **Incremental Measurements**: Next, add a second measurement by bending one knuckle of the same finger. This will give you a sense of the jaw's range of motion. \n\n3. **Maximum Range**: For a more comprehensive measurement, use two fingers and measure up to the first knuckle. This is considered a reasonable range of motion for most individuals. You can also measure three fingers up to the first knuckle, which is often regarded as the maximum range of motion [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:53-04:56].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: If you suspect your jaw is locked due to an interarticular problem or disc dislocation, avoid forcing the jaw open, as this could worsen the condition. It's advisable to consult a healthcare professional if you experience pain or difficulty [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:53-04:56]. \n\nBy following these steps, you",

          "text": "couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's",

If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem.

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse.

Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is find a wine cork. Of course, I prefer the Buffalo TMJ Kick, the click corks, but you could really use any old wine cork for many old wine bottles. What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back",

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is",

And I want you to gently roll it back and forth, side to side, front and back, and just play with it. Let the muscles relax as you're doing this, and play with it as much as you want over the course of a day, as much as your muscles can tolerate. You don't want to push it too hard and you don't want the muscles to get sore. And of course you don't want to overwork or overstrain these compromised joints. Now even though I can't guarantee that this is going to work for you, I can tell you that it is possible and it's safe. I just had a patient last week who I set home with a cork and her jaw unlocked within a few days. The last thing that I want to say is I want to stress to you that even if your jaw unlocks, it's very, very likely that it's going to become locked again. When you clench in your back teeth, you're going to drive the condile behind the disc again and there's a good chance you'll get stuck there.

First, understand that forcibly manipulating a locked jaw can worsen the problem, so avoid any aggressive attempts to open the jaw [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 01:16-01:20]. \n\n1. Assess the situation: Determine how far your jaw can open. Typically, if it\u2019s a joint issue, the maximum opening is about 22 to 23 millimeters [Video 3: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 02:23-02:26]. \n\n2. Obtain a cork: Use a cork, such as the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork, which is specifically designed for this purpose [Video 3].\n\n3. Position the cork: Place the cork between your teeth, ensuring it is comfortable and not forcing your jaw open.\n\n4. Gently apply pressure: Allow the cork to help create a slight gap, which may help loosen tight muscles and facilitate movement without forcing the jaw [Video 2: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 02:02-02:03].\n\nAlways prioritize gentle techniques and consult a healthcare professional if the issue persists.",

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what",

      "answer": "To stimulate the vagus nerve and potentially improve mental health, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Practice Deep Breathing**: Engage in deep breathing exercises. Inhale deeply to a count of four, hold for one to two seconds, and exhale to a count of six. This technique promotes relaxation and stimulates the vagus nerve [Video 1: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 10:33-10:43].\n\n2. **Incorporate Laughter**: Laughter has been shown to increase vagal tone. Engage in activities that make you laugh, as this can enhance the stimulation of the vagus nerve [Video 2: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 11:13-11:19].\n\n3. **Utilize Probiotics**: Taking probiotics can amplify the effects of vagal nerve stimulation. Consider incorporating probiotics into your diet for additional benefits [Video 3: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 11:37-11:45].\n\n4. **Exercise Regularly**: Physical activity is beneficial for increasing vagal nerve tone. Aim for regular exercise to support overall mental health [Video 3].\n\n5. **",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement.

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip.

This could be a traditional mantra or a phrase that you find calming.\n\n2. **Find a Quiet Space**: Ensure you are in a quiet environment where you can focus without distractions. This helps in maximizing the benefits of chanting.\n\n3. **Stimulate the Vagus Nerve**: Chanting can stimulate the vagus nerve, which may help in improving your overall well-being and potentially alleviate tinnitus symptoms. Singing or chanting is mentioned as a way to achieve this stimulation [Video 2: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 09:07-09:09].\n\n4. **Practice Regularly**: Incorporate chanting into your daily routine. Regular practice may enhance its effectiveness in managing tinnitus.\n\n5. **Combine with Other Techniques**: Consider combining chanting with other vagus nerve stimulation techniques, such as yoga poses like the cat-cow or downward dog, which can also be beneficial [Video 1: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 09:19-09:20].\n\nAlways listen",

So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that. And then you, a lot of times, they recommend perspreading, which is your blowing, it's like you're blowing out a candle. In some instances, they even say take your tongue and put it between the teeth and the front gums. And there's different eyes of the tongue right behind the, on the roof of the mouth right behind the teeth. And even I've heard you do with this, like make the noise, sure, you know.

Like you can do anywhere from like three seconds all the way up to nine seconds for each side of the box. Right. So you're going to breathe in, inhale, let's take three seconds. Okay. And you do it, Brad. Okay. I'm going to be talking. Inhale for three seconds, hold for three seconds, one, two, three, exhale for three seconds, and then hold one more time for three seconds. There you go. Start it again. And then start it again. And you decide what length works for you. Brad and I were just discussing this. The next one's called 478. I always do a little variation of that. I'll hold it longer than they recommend and you said to you I hold a less than 7 seconds and this one you find the one that works for you again three seconds in hold three seconds out hold that real simple to do next one is four seven eight yeah this is my favorite this is the one I'll use at night sometimes or in the car in this one you breathe in for four hold for seven which is quite a good",

There you go. Start it again. And then start it again. And you decide what length works for you. Brad and I were just discussing this. The next one's called 478. I always do a little variation of that. I'll hold it longer than they recommend and you said to you I hold a less than 7 seconds and this one you find the one that works for you again three seconds in hold three seconds out hold that real simple to do next one is four seven eight yeah this is my favorite this is the one I'll use at night sometimes or in the car in this one you breathe in for four hold for seven which is quite a good",

Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully.

And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that you do diaphragmatic breathing and that's basically belly breathing. So instead of when you breathe in, you're not trying to expand your chest, you're trying to expand the diaphragm, which is in the belly. Right. So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that. And then you, a lot of times, they recommend perspreading, which is your blowing, it's like you're blowing out a candle. In some instances, they even say take your tongue and put it between the teeth and the front gums. And there's different eyes of the tongue right behind the, on the roof of",

      "answer": "To practice box breathing, follow these steps: first, inhale deeply through your nose for a count that you choose, typically four seconds. Next, hold your breath for the same count. Then, exhale slowly through your mouth for the same duration, and finally, hold your breath again for that same count before starting the cycle over. This method is often visualized as a box, where each side represents one of the four steps: inhale, hold, exhale, and hold again [Video 1: 2oXoiQfija4, Time: 04:25-04:31].\n\nBox breathing is particularly beneficial for managing anxiety and stress, as it helps regulate your breathing pattern and promotes relaxation. It is utilized by special forces in the military to maintain calmness before missions, highlighting its effectiveness in high-pressure situations [Video 1: 2oXoiQfija4, Time: 04:25-04:31].\n\nIn summary, box breathing involves a structured approach to inhaling, holding, exhaling, and holding again, which can significantly aid in reducing anxiety and improving focus.",

Like you can do anywhere from like three seconds all the way up to nine seconds for each side of the box. Right. So you're going to breathe in, inhale, let's take three seconds. Okay. And you do it, Brad. Okay. I'm going to be talking. Inhale for three seconds, hold for three seconds, one, two, three, exhale for three seconds, and then hold one more time for three seconds. There you go. Start it again. And then start it again. And you decide what length works for you. Brad and I were just discussing this. The next one's called 478. I always do a little variation of that. I'll hold it longer than they recommend and you said to you I hold a less than 7 seconds and this one you find the one that works for you again three seconds in hold three seconds out hold that real simple to do next one is four seven eight yeah this is my favorite this is the one I'll use at night sometimes or in the car in this one you breathe in for four hold for seven which is quite a good",

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

Bob, before you go any further, I did want to interject my personal experience with breathing before, because we're given three systems of how to learn to breathe, but I started focusing on my breathing in my early 20s when I started the martial arts and they focus every classic, breathe in, breathe out, how important it is, right? Right? And and another thing with relaxation in I keto is like this really works, it could really make your stress level from here down here just by focusing on how you breathe and I can you can do these things in your car if you're stressed out on on the way to work or on the way home, you know, bad. That's where I usually do it Brad, I use it. I did this morning. Yeah. I know I was going to be meeting with you. And it's big stuff that things come down so. But you know, when I talk to people or anxious, I can see their breathing is rapid, right? And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that",

It takes me some. The third one, which by the way seems to fit with the name, I guess you'd call it third breathing. Sure. So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right. And you want to need to find out which one of these works best for you. And maybe or even a little variation of one of these. But pick the time about what length you want to go. I can't recommend this enough red. I mean, it's just people get anxiety attacks and stuff like that. It's always the shallow breathing on them that you can see. All right, thanks. Good luck with it.

Next, hold your breath for a count of seven seconds. Finally, exhale completely through your mouth for a count of eight seconds. This technique is designed to promote relaxation and can be particularly effective in reducing anxiety levels. \n\nThe four, seven, eight method is beneficial because it encourages deep, rhythmic breathing, which can help to calm the nervous system and reduce stress. As mentioned, this exercise can be practiced at various times, such as before sleep or even while driving, making it a versatile tool for managing anxiety [Video 2: 2oXoiQfija4, Time: 05:20-05:23]. \n\nIn summary, the four, seven, eight breathing exercise involves inhaling for four seconds, holding for seven seconds, and exhaling for eight seconds. This practice can significantly lower stress and anxiety levels when incorporated into your daily routine.",

Bob, before you go any further, I did want to interject my personal experience with breathing before, because we're given three systems of how to learn to breathe, but I started focusing on my breathing in my early 20s when I started the martial arts and they focus every classic, breathe in, breathe out, how important it is, right? Right? And and another thing with relaxation in I keto is like this really works, it could really make your stress level from here down here just by focusing on how you breathe and I can you can do these things in your car if you're stressed out on on the way to work or on the way home, you know, bad. That's where I usually do it Brad, I use it. I did this morning. Yeah. I know I was going to be meeting with you. And it's big stuff that things come down so. But you know, when I talk to people or anxious, I can see their breathing is rapid, right? And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that",

This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock?

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what",

This is actually used by a lot of the arm services special forces or you can imagine Brad how important is for them to keep their anxiety levels down. They're in the plane ready to go on a mission. Sure. So it's called box breathing. So you can picture a box and you're going to pick the length of time. Like you can do anywhere from like three seconds all the way up to nine seconds for each side of the box. Right. So you're going to breathe in, inhale, let's take three seconds. Okay. And you do it, Brad. Okay. I'm going to be talking. Inhale for three seconds, hold for three seconds, one, two, three, exhale for three seconds, and then hold one more time for three seconds. There you go. Start it again. And then start it again. And you decide what length works for you. Brad and I were just discussing this. The next one's called 478. I always do a little variation of that. I'll hold it longer than they recommend and you said to you I hold a less than 7 seconds and",

So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right. And you want to need to find out which one of these works best for you. And maybe or even a little variation of one of these. But pick the time about what length you want to go. I can't recommend this enough red. I mean, it's just people get anxiety attacks and stuff like that. It's always the shallow breathing on them that you can see. All right, thanks. Good luck with it.

A benign mole generally has smooth and even borders as shown here. The borders of a melanoma, as shown here, may be uneven with scalloped, notched, or trailing edges. C stands for color variation. Most benign moles have one or two evenly distributed colors. Having a variety of colors, including brown, black, white, red, and or blue may be a feature of melanoma. D stands for diameter greater than half a centimeter. Although melanomas may be larger and diameter than the eraser head on your pencil, they may sometimes be smaller when first detected. The last letter E stands for evolution. In most cases, benign moles are stable over time. time. Be on alert when a mole starts to evolve or change in any way. When a mole is evolving, see a doctor. Any change in size, shape, color, texture, elevation, or any new symptom, such as bleeding, itching or scabbing, maybe a sign of malignancy. Thanks for watching!",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip.

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

      "answer": "To detect signs of skin cancer, particularly melanoma, you can follow the ABCDE method:\n\n1. **Asymmetry**: Examine the mole or spot on your skin. If you draw a line through the middle and the two halves do not match, this asymmetry is a warning sign for melanoma [Video 1: hXYd0WRhzN4, Time: 01:03-01:08].\n\n2. **Border Irregularity**: Look at the edges of the mole. Benign moles typically have smooth, even borders. If the borders are irregular, jagged, or blurred, this could indicate a potential problem [Video 1].\n\n3. **Color Variation**: Check for multiple colors within the mole, such as shades of brown, black, or even patches of pink, red, white, or blue. A uniform color is generally a good sign.\n\n4. **Diameter**: Measure the size of the mole. Melanomas are usually larger than 6mm (about the size of a pencil eraser), but they can be smaller.\n\n5. **Evolving**: Monitor any changes in the mole over time, including size, shape, color, or elevation. Any significant changes warrant",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back",

But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

This position is crucial for isolating the external rotators [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:53-05:00].\n\n3. **Weight Setup**: Hold a dumbbell or a similar weight in your hand, keeping it in front of you. Ensure that the weight is manageable to avoid strain [Video 2: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:27-04:34].\n\n4. **Movement**: Rotate your arm upward, lifting the weight towards the ceiling while keeping your elbow tucked into your side.

I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front",

So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators.

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down.

These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through",

Your forearm should be perpendicular to your body with the weight positioned in front of you [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:15-05:20].\n\n2. **Movement**: Keeping your elbow tucked into your side, slowly rotate the weight upwards towards the ceiling. This motion should be controlled, as you are working against gravity [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48].\n\n3. **Repetitions**: Perform this exercise for a set number of repetitions, ensuring that you maintain proper form throughout. Avoid using heavy weights initially to prevent strain [Video 1].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: It is crucial to perform this exercise lying down rather than standing, as this position provides better support and reduces the risk of injury. Always listen to your body and stop if you experience pain [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: ",

I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back",

And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their",

Attach a handle to the cable.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Hold the handle with the arm closest to the machine. Keep your elbow at a 90-degree angle and close to your side. This position is crucial for isolating the rotator cuff muscles effectively [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:27-04:34].\n\n3. **Execution**: Rotate your forearm away from your body while keeping your elbow fixed at your side. This motion should be controlled and deliberate, focusing on the external rotation of the shoulder [Video 2: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48].\n\n4. **Resistance**: Ensure that the resistance is directed straight down, which allows for effective engagement of the rotator cuff during the rotation [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Perform the exercise for a set number of repetitions, typically 10-15, ensuring you maintain good form throughout.\n\n**Safety Note**:",

In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity.

So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their",

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

Attach a handle to the cable.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Grasp the handle with the hand closest to the machine. Keep your elbow at a 90-degree angle and close to your side. This position is crucial for targeting the external rotators effectively [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:27-04:34].\n\n3. **Execution**: Rotate your arm outward away from your body while keeping your elbow tucked in. This motion should be controlled and deliberate, resisting the pull of the cable [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48]. \n\n4. **Repetition**: Perform the exercise for several repetitions, ensuring that you maintain proper form throughout. Avoid using excessive weight to prevent injury.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: It is recommended to perform this exercise in a stable position, ideally seated or lying down, to minimize strain on the shoulder and maintain focus on the rotator cuff [Video",

Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front",

So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal and external rotation. And then I want to show you an extension exercise that I really like also. Now to demonstrate that, let me show you what it's not first. And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their",

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down.

And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those.

You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here.

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself.

If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out.

The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side.

This involves gently pulling your chin towards your chest while keeping your shoulders relaxed. This movement helps to realign the cervical spine and can alleviate stiffness [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 05:01-05:07].\n\n2. **Neck Stretch**: Next, perform a side stretch. Position your hand above your ear and gently pull your head to the side, away from the shoulder. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds. Repeat this on both sides, ideally doing three stretches on each side for optimal results [Video 3: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:27-03:29].\n\n3. **Support**: When performing these movements, consider using a small support at the base of your neck to enhance comfort and effectiveness. Avoid placing support too high on the neck to prevent strain [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 05:01-05:07].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always listen to your body. If any",

If the bleeding is external, apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or bandage. Elevate the injured area above the heart if possible to reduce blood flow. If the bleeding does not stop after several minutes of continuous pressure, apply additional dressings without removing the initial ones to avoid disrupting any clotting that may have begun.\n\nIn cases of severe internal bleeding, monitor the victim's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC). Keep the victim lying on their left side to prevent aspiration of vomit, which can occur if they are unconscious or semi-conscious. It is essential to seek immediate medical attention, as severe bleeding can lead to shock, a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate blood flow to the organs [Video 1: KMpG4A1-dZ4, Time: 01:27-01:36; 02:30-02:36]. \n\nIn summary, apply direct pressure for external bleeding, monitor vital signs, position the victim appropriately, and seek emergency help promptly.",

So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade. It needs to be seated in the right location and it needs to stay in that right location throughout movement as we're going through this motion. If it doesn't, that's what can lead to some of the problems that we might experience and some of the pain that you might be experiencing. a lot of times in my experience. If you get pain kind of reaching up an overhead or just with certain shoulder motions in general, oftentimes it's because of that rotator calf. The rotator calf is not strong enough to keep that the ball squarely seated in your socket. Over time, that can lead to pain and pinching and inflammation irritation, even like a rotator calf tear, which we absolutely want to avoid. If we do the right exercises for it, we actually can't avoid that. Now, if you do have those symptoms that pain in your shoulder, I did shoot a video, it's just last week, all about shoulder impingement. It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms hang down, the wrists should come up even with the handles here. Right, so if they're like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well. And these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other right. But first, how do we make sure that the height is right down there? That's good point. Let's make sure",

With the opposite hand, you're going to reach down for the chair or the bed. If you have a chair rest, it will be easier to reach for that. You kick the affected forward and you have a seat. Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this. Once your crutches are fit correctly and you're standing up, you're going to bring one crutch around to the other side and stand up tall. Your doctor will let you know",

Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade. It needs to be seated in the right location and it needs to stay in that right location throughout movement as we're going through this motion. If it doesn't, that's what can lead to some of the problems that we might experience and some of the pain that you might be experiencing. a lot of times in my experience. If you get pain kind of reaching up an overhead or just with certain shoulder motions in general, oftentimes it's because of that rotator calf. The rotator calf is not strong enough to keep that the ball squarely seated in your socket. Over time, that can lead to pain and pinching and inflammation irritation, even like a rotator calf tear, which we absolutely want to avoid. If we do the right exercises for it, we actually can't avoid that. Now, if you do have those symptoms that pain in your shoulder, I did shoot a video, it's just last week, all about shoulder impingement. It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up",

      "answer": "To check if your crutches fit properly, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Stand Up Straight**: Begin by standing up straight with your crutches positioned under your arms. The top of the crutches should be about 1-2 inches below your armpits. This ensures that your arms can comfortably reach the hand grips without excessive strain.\n\n2. **Adjust the Hand Grips**: While standing, your elbows should be slightly bent (about 15-30 degrees) when holding the hand grips. This positioning allows for better control and comfort while using the crutches [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 00:38-00:43].\n\n3. **Check for Stability**: Ensure that when you place weight on the crutches, they feel stable and secure. You should not feel any excessive pressure under your armpits; if you do, the crutches may be too high.\n\n4. **Test Movement**: Practice moving with the crutches to ensure you can walk comfortably and maintain balance. If you struggle to move or feel unsteady, further adjustments may be necessary [Video 1].\n\nRemember, proper fitting is crucial for safety and effective use of crutches.",

Reach for the hand railing and you step up with your good leg, so you're going to put weight through both hands, step up with your left foot, and then you bring your crutches up. And my injured leg is hanging behind me. You're going to push through your hands and step up again. Once you're at the top of the staircase, case, bring one crutch around again, and continue walking. To descend the stairs, you're going to bring your crutches around to the opposite side as the railing that you're using and take a hold of the handrail with the other hand. To go down, you go down with your crutches first, then your injured leg comes forward, And you put the weight through your hands to step with your left foot. One step at a time. So I'll always remember to follow your doctor's orders as far as how much weight you can put through your injured leg.

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms hang down, the wrists should come up even with the handles here. Right, so if they're like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well. And these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other right. But first, how do we make sure that the height is right down there? That's good point. Let's make sure",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

      "answer": "To stand up with crutches, begin by ensuring your crutches are correctly fitted and positioned. Place your crutches under your arms, using both hands to support your weight. Next, step up with your unaffected leg while pushing down through your hands on the crutches. This helps to lift your body as you bring your injured leg behind you. After stepping up, bring your crutches forward to maintain balance and stability. Once you are standing tall, you can adjust one crutch to the opposite side for better support as you prepare to walk [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 04:44-04:50; Video 2: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 03:30-03:35].\n\nIn summary, the process involves using your upper body strength to push through the crutches while stepping up with your good leg. This technique ensures you maintain balance and reduces the risk of falling. Always follow your healthcare provider's instructions regarding weight-bearing limits during this process.",

If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove.

You're going to put your affected extremity or leg forward. Both crutches will be on the side of the injured leg. You're going to push up from the hand grips with one hand in the chair or the bed with the opposite hand. So you're going to lean forward, push up with both arms.

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms hang down, the wrists should come up even with the handles here. Right, so if they're like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well. And these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other right. But first, how do we make sure that the height is right down there? That's good point. Let's make sure",

Reach down for the hand grips of the crutches, ensuring you have a firm hold. With your unaffected hand, grasp the armrest of the chair or the edge of the bed for support. As you prepare to sit, kick your affected leg forward slightly to help with balance and stability. Then, lower yourself into the chair or onto the bed while keeping your crutches close to you for support during the transition [Video 3: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 03:05-03:08].\n\nIn summary, the process involves securing your crutches, using your unaffected side for support, and carefully lowering yourself while managing your affected leg. This method ensures safety and stability while sitting down.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

When standing, bring one crutch around from your unaffected side to your injured side, ensuring you maintain a tall posture [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 03:30-03:35]. \n\nAs you prepare to move, position the crutches under your armpits and grasp the hand grips. With your opposite hand, reach for a stable surface like a chair or bed for support [Video 3: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 03:05-03:08]. When you begin to walk, swing the crutches forward while keeping your affected leg slightly ahead. This technique helps distribute your weight properly and maintain balance.\n\nIn summary, proper crutch walking involves correct fitting, maintaining an upright posture, and using stable surfaces for support. Following these steps will enhance your mobility and safety while using crutches. For more detailed guidance, refer to the video segments provided.",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms hang down, the wrists should come up even with the handles here. Right, so if they're like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well. And these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other right.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it.

Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this. Once your crutches are fit correctly and you're standing up, you're going to bring one crutch around to the other side and stand up tall. Your doctor will let you know how much weight you can put through your leg. For this video, I'm demonstrating not putting any weight through my injured leg. You're going to bring your crutches forward first, swing the affected or injured leg forward first, and then take a small step with your good leg. forward, step. As you get better, you can start to take longer steps. To ascend and descend stairs, take steps until you're as close to the staircase as you can be. If you have a railing, you want to use the railing if it's available. The first thing you're going to do is take one of the crutches out from the side that you're using the railing on.

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms hang down, the wrists should come up even with the handles here. Right, so if they're like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well. And these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other right. But first, how do we make sure that the height is right down there? That's good point. Let's make sure",

Start by removing one crutch from the side where you are holding the railing and place both crutches under the opposite arm. This allows you to maintain balance while descending.

Finally, step down with your good leg [Video 2: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 04:23-04:29; Video 3: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 03:57-04:02].\n\nIn summary, descending stairs with crutches involves using the railing for stability, placing crutches down first, and stepping down with the good leg while keeping the injured leg elevated. This method helps to maintain balance and prevent falls while navigating stairs. Always ensure you are comfortable with the technique before attempting it independently.",

But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood",

So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right, and I'm going to bend it because what we're going to do is lunge into this to get a pushing sensation into the shoulder to draw backwards. So this is the first part. I'm going to take my right hand, I'm going to place on the opposite side of the door frame and I'm going to pull into my body weight, I should say,",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

The idea is you do these throughout the day and that's why we usually pick one and usually why it only wants to take 30 seconds. You take 30 seconds out of your day and do the stretch real quick and then move on and you're going to have better results by spreading out over the day instead of doing one long workout or stretch. And that goes for a lot of our stretches. But sure, I'll post your stretches. Yeah. So shall we carry on, Bob? Sure. Now, again, these are, these are shown success with us personally in the clinic with our patients. So they're the real deal. Can you, are you gonna have to? Oh, I can say, you want me to do any of them. You want, yeah, go ahead. You want this? No, no, lay down, Bob. I prefer hook rotation. I'm gonna lie down. Lie down, oh, I want to go to F5. So I got in correctly. Yeah, I did. I didn't go in like this. This is what's a lot of stress on the back. You go onto your side, bring your feet up, and then roll over as long as it's still roll off the bat. You can do these with a pillow, but we're not going to know. You can do these in bed even.

This can provide better support for your lower back [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 05:30-05:33].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Start by backing up to the edge of the bed. Ensure that your back is against the bed before you begin to lower yourself. This helps maintain balance and prevents strain on your back [Video 3: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 02:46-02:51].\n\n3. **Lowering Yourself**: Gently lower your body by bending your knees and bringing your legs onto the bed while keeping your back straight. Avoid twisting your torso as you move to prevent additional strain on your lower back.\n\n4. **Final Position**: Once lying down, you can adjust your position to find comfort. If needed, consider using pillows to support your lower back and maintain a neutral spine alignment.\n\nAlways listen to your body and stop if you experience pain. If lying down causes discomfort",

And stretching out your legs is a great way to prevent all of that. So again, just within our stretching now, a little bit, getting that break in between. And then we've got one more on each side. So with the quad stretch, you should feel it right through here. Some people feel it a little bit more in their knee, That could be because maybe that joint is tight as well. So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your",

The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation and the strength in your arms so that when you put your hands on the crutches you do have a slight bend in your elbow and a slight gap underneath your armpits of about two finger widths. You're going to put your affected extremity or leg forward. Both crutches will be on the side of the injured leg. You're going to push up from the hand grips with one hand in the chair or the bed with the opposite hand. So you're going to lean forward, push up with both arms. Once you have your balance, you bring one crutch around to the opposite side and place both crutches beneath your armpits. And you can see that I am using the surface behind me, the chair, a little bit just to get some balance when I'm transferring one crutch from one side to the other. When you go from a standing position to a seated position, whether that be a chair or a bed behind you, you want to back all the way up to the surface with your crutches until you feel the chair or the bed behind your unaffected leg.",

Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there.

Aim for a controlled motion; do not hold your back or legs rigidly. Perform this movement for about eight to ten repetitions, and consider doing three sets. You can repeat this every hour or two to help relieve tension in the lower back [Video 1: 0w1GlJTH2x4, Time: 01:12-01:20].\n\nAdditionally, you can incorporate a single-leg stretch. While lying back, extend one leg while keeping the other bent, ensuring your back stays straight. This stretch helps maintain balance and flexibility in the lower back [Video 2: 0w1GlJTH2x4, Time: 01:42-01:50].

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee.

So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on.

Now if you don't feel any pain or severe pain, you are now ready to lean side to side. Nice and slow. This will mobilize the wrist and wrist extension and also stretch out the wrist flex muscle. To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting. Move side to side for about 20 to 30 reps and repeat it for the five times. Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow stretch. To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a",

And then we've got one more on each side. So with the quad stretch, you should feel it right through here. Some people feel it a little bit more in their knee, That could be because maybe that joint is tight as well. So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on.

You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

And so this is a good way just to keep those muscles moving, especially if you don't get to move your legs throughout the day because you don't want to get blood clots or DVDs, anything like that. And stretching out your legs is a great way to prevent all of that. So again, just within our stretching now, a little bit, getting that break in between. And then we've got one more on each side. So with the quad stretch, you should feel it right through here. Some people feel it a little bit more in their knee, That could be because maybe that joint is tight as well. So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your",

For example, gymnastics, yoga, Olympic weightlifting, woodworking, or any repetitive strain in juicing tasks such as desewer, body weighted wrist stretches. To stretch the wrist flexors, find a table or bench that plays the palm of your hand on top of the table and lean and body weight on them. This should create a slight stretch already. If you still don't feel the stretch, slightly lean forward with your body weight until you feel a slight stretch, the back of your wrist or in the inner portion of your forearm. Now if you don't feel any pain or severe pain, you are now ready to lean side to side. Nice and slow. This will mobilize the wrist and wrist extension and also stretch out the wrist flex muscle. To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and",

      "answer": "To stretch while in bed for lower back pain relief, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Side Bending Stretch**: Start by lying on your back. Gently bend your head to one side, applying light pressure with your hand. Hold this position for 30 seconds. Repeat this stretch three times on each side. This helps alleviate tension in the neck and upper back, which can contribute to lower back pain [Video 1: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 01:01-01:07].\n\n2. **Gentle Elbow Stretch**: While lying on your side, take the arm on the side you want to stretch and place your hand on the back of your head. Gently pull your elbow upward while keeping your shoulder down. This can help relieve stiffness in the upper neck and back area, which may indirectly benefit your lower back [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 07:27-07:29].\n\n**Safety Notes**: Ensure that you perform these stretches gently to avoid exacerbating any pain. If you experience significant discomfort, reduce the intensity of the stretch or consult a healthcare professional. Always listen to your body and stop if the pain",

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

And then we've got one more on each side. So with the quad stretch, you should feel it right through here. Some people feel it a little bit more in their knee, That could be because maybe that joint is tight as well. So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on.

So with the quad stretch, you should feel it right through here. Some people feel it a little bit more in their knee, That could be because maybe that joint is tight as well. So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your",

You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it. Most of the time, you should be able to get rid of the pain by doing what I've shown you. If not, come in for a visit. The sooner you come in, the easier it is to treat and the faster you get better.

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all. So again, holding that for 30 seconds, doing that three times, probably on each side, if you've got just some general next stiffness, and you can do that a couple of times a day. So I'll do the other side, holding this one up with my elbow, hand behind my head, pulling down towards the opposite side. So again, really holding it for 30 seconds, get that good stretch in there. I like to alternate back and forth. You don't have to, you can do them all on one",

      "answer": "To stretch while lying down for lower back pain relief, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start Position**: Lie flat on your back on a comfortable surface. Ensure your head and neck are supported.\n\n2. **Knees to Chest Stretch**: Gently pull your knees towards your chest. You can do this one knee at a time or both together. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds. This stretch helps relieve tension in the lower back.\n\n3. **Side Bending Stretch**: While lying on your back, you can also perform a side bending stretch. Bend your head gently to one side, applying light pressure with your hand. Hold this position for 30 seconds and then switch to the other side. Repeat this stretch three times on each side to help alleviate tension in the neck and upper back, which can indirectly benefit the lower back as well [Video 1: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 01:01-01:07].\n\n4. **Safety Note**: If you experience any pain during these stretches, ease off and perform them gently to avoid exacerbating your discomfort. Always listen to your body and consult with a healthcare professional if pain persists. \n\nThese stretches can help",

If it makes it feel better, they're more you do it. That's the one you're going to put on your two-do list. It's a directional thing. That's a trying to determine which direction feels the best and the other thing I hope it's okay I recommend this Brad. The idea is that you do these once a day. The idea is you do these throughout the day and that's why we usually pick one and usually why it only wants to take 30 seconds. You take 30 seconds out of your day and do the stretch real quick and then move on and you're going to have better results by spreading out over the day instead of doing one long workout or stretch. And that goes for a lot of our stretches. But sure, I'll post your stretches. Yeah. So shall we carry on, Bob? Sure.

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive.

Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it. Most of the time, you should be able to get rid of the pain by doing what I've shown you. If not, come in for a visit. The sooner you come in, the easier it is to treat and the faster you get better. If it persists for several weeks or more, then it becomes more difficult to treat and you can take a longer day of better.

This will help you focus on the right areas during exercise [Video 2: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 01:55-02:01].\n\n2. **Gentle Stretching**: Start with gentle stretches. For example, you can stretch one side of your back by placing your hand on the opposite side and leaning towards it. This helps to elongate the muscles and relieve tension [Video 3: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 07:27-07:29].\n\n3. **Perform Multiple Exercises**: Bob and Brad suggest trying several exercises to find which ones alleviate your discomfort. They recommend doing all six exercises they demonstrate to see which ones work best for you [Video 2].\n\n4. **Listen to Your Body**: It\u2019s crucial to pay attention to how your body responds. If any exercise causes pain, stop immediately and consult a professional if necessary [Video 2].\n\nBy",

So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down here and remember be safe don't follow over when you're stretching, how fun and how we feel that are seen.",

Now these mobilization techniques and stretches are going to prevent you from RSI which is repetitive strain injury and a couple of tunnel syndrome. So you alleviate the pain from there or you can prevent you from getting these issues. Now if you're finding that you're losing a lot of grip strength from for example sports For example, golf or even tennis, these stretches and mobilization techniques are going to help you regain that grip strength once again, and even alleviate the pain that you might be getting from golf as elbow or tennis elbow. Try these stretches out, they're definitely going to help you. waves. Interlace your fingers and create a wave back and forth with the wrist and hands. Try to exaggerate each wrist extension and wrist flexion on each movement. Do this nice and slow and in a controlled manner. Do about 20 to 30 reps three to four sets. wrist rolls.

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

This gets from the low back even in the thoracic, and then going up, I bring my head up to the other direction, and I arched the back to the other direction.

So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on.

Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

Ensure it is at a comfortable height for you to reach.\n\n2. **Grip the Bar**: Stand under the bar and reach up to grasp it with both hands. Your grip should be shoulder-width apart for stability.\n\n3. **Hang Freely**: Allow your body to hang down, letting gravity assist in stretching your lower back. Keep your legs straight or slightly bent, depending on your comfort level. This position helps decompress the spine and relieve tension.\n\n4. **Hold the Position**: Maintain the hanging position for about 10 to 15 seconds. You can repeat this for three to four rounds, as suggested for effective stretching [Video 2: 0w1GlJTH2x4, Time: 01:53-01:57].\n\n5. **Relax and Breathe**: While hanging, focus on relaxing your back and breathing deeply. This will enhance the stretch and help release tension.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that your grip is secure and that you are not overextending your back. If you feel any pain, discontinue the stretch immediately",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

It is easy to go straight through the radial artery if you rush, you may feel a slight give as the needle penetrates the wall of the radial artery. Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe. If you don't see blood, you have missed the artery and will have to withdraw the needle somewhat and then re-aign the syringe toward the pulsating artery. Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10 minutes, use a turniquet over the cotton ball to apply pressure. Place the syringe onto the ice, pack ice cubes over the syringe, and send it off to the lab right away, arterial blood gas or ABG samples should be analyzed within 10 minutes of collection for accurate results.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears.

Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove.

If blood is not visible, you may have missed the artery; in this case, withdraw the needle slightly and re-align towards the pulsating site [Video 2].\n\n5. **Stabilize the Patient's Arm**: Instruct the patient to keep their arm and wrist still to prevent dislodging the needle during the procedure [Video 2].\n\n6. **",

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip. If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes. And lastly, pull the sliding barrel back so it locks into place the spring loaded land set that we fitted earlier. Place it on your skin firmly and click the bone so it releases the land set to pump your skin for the blood sample. So often as",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. do it. Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

Next, remove a test route from the vinyl and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point a warmer and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now, a word of warning for the next scene, there will be a little bit of blood. So if you don't like the site of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll put the information in the description too. Now let's do it. do it. Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears.",

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

This action should automatically turn the device on and indicate when it's ready for a blood sample [Video 1: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 03:24-03:30].\n\n2. **Obtain a Blood Sample**: Clean the fingertip with a cotton swab. Wipe away the first drop of blood to ensure accuracy, then gently touch the second drop of blood to the test strip. The strip will draw the blood in [Video 3: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 04:04-04:05].\n\n3. **Read the Result**: After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. It\u2019s important to document this reading in a monitoring diary or electronic records for tracking purposes [Video 2: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 04:23-04:28].\n\n**Safety Note**: If you are uncomfortable with the sight of blood, be aware that the procedure involves blood sampling. You may want to skip forward during the demonstration if needed [Video ",

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video.

So, so, continuing on from our Lansing device part, to test out the glucose, we need to get a few things ready. So we need the glucose monitor, it's the civic test strips that are in date. A primed and ready-to-use lancing device which we did earlier. A column wall pad, a yellow sharp spin, and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test route from the vinyl and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point a warmer and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now, a word of warning for the next scene, there will be a little bit of blood. So if you don't like the site of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds.

This will puncture your skin and draw a small blood sample [Video 2: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 02:15-02:19].\n\n3. **Apply Blood to the Testing Strip**: Once you have a blood droplet, carefully touch the edge of the testing strip to the blood. Ensure that the blood fills the designated area on the strip, as this is crucial for an accurate reading.\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Always use a clean lancing device and testing strip to avoid contamination. Dispose of used lancets properly to prevent injury.\n\n5. **Record Your Results**: After testing, document your blood glucose level in a monitoring diary or electronic records",

A pig flow meter is easy to use, even children as young as four should be able to perform a pig flow with good results. Let's take a look at how it's done. Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe but are now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. TIP FIVE! That's it. A yellow shark's been an out-one or two-ing diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips. How can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?",

If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove.

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down.",

      "answer": "To use a peak flow meter, start by standing up straight. Hold the meter so that the indicator is at the bottom when you place it in your mouth. This positioning ensures accurate measurement. After that, take a deep breath, filling your lungs completely, and then seal your lips around the mouthpiece of the meter. Exhale forcefully and quickly into the device to obtain your peak flow reading. It is important to perform this test consistently, ideally at the same time each day, to monitor your lung function effectively. \n\nThe peak flow meter is designed to be user-friendly, making it suitable for individuals as young as four years old, which emphasizes its accessibility for patients of all ages [Video 1: RRLY6anXXQo, Time: 00:27-00:33]. Regular use of the meter can help track changes in your respiratory condition and guide your asthma management plan. In summary, using a peak flow meter involves proper positioning, deep inhalation, and forceful exhalation to measure lung function accurately.",

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

If bloodshed through both dressings, remove them and apply a fresh bandage, ensuring they's direct pressure applied at the point of bleeding. Support the injured part with a sling or bandage. But check circulation every 10 minutes. Keep monitoring the casualties level of response while waiting for help to arrive. So remember, when treating severe bleeding, wear gloves if available.

Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done!

Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove.

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

Here's the socket. Here's the ball It's actually the most mobile joint in the body We have the greatest range of motion available in three different planes of movement in our shoulder joint It's a very mobile joint, but then at the same time it needs to be a very stable joint. That's where that rotator cuff comes in. So again, what you're looking at here, this is my right shoulder blade. Looks just like that with the humorous, the arm bone hanging down right here. You've got four muscles that come off of your shoulder blade. Three of them come from the back, one of them comes from the front.

Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade. It needs to be seated in the right location and it needs to stay in that right location throughout movement as we're going through this motion.

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

Yes, which you're going to find out how useful this can be for after surgery as well as before surgery. So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

You're going to bring your crutches forward first, swing the affected or injured leg forward first, and then take a small step with your good leg. forward, step. As you get better, you can start to take longer steps. To ascend and descend stairs, take steps until you're as close to the staircase as you can be. If you have a railing, you want to use the railing if it's available. The first thing you're going to do is take one of the crutches out from the side that you're using the railing on.

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms hang down, the wrists should come up even with the handles here. Right, so if they're like this, if they're lined up down here, these have to be moved as well. And these unfortunately do not adjust near as easily as the other right. But first, how do we make sure that the height is right down there? That's good point. Let's make sure",

          "text": "Hi, my name is Lisa, and I'm a physical therapist here at the Nebraska Medical Center. And I'm here today to show you some basic tips for how to use crutches correctly. If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

This allows for optimal support and balance while using the crutches. Although the provided video evidence does not specifically detail the adjustment process, it emphasizes the importance of positioning the crutches correctly when transitioning from a standing to a seated position. \n\nFor instance, when preparing to sit, you should back up to the chair or bed until you feel it against your unaffected leg. Then, bring the crutches around from your unaffected side to your injured side, ensuring that you maintain balance while reaching for the hand grips. This technique helps in stabilizing your posture and managing weight distribution effectively [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 02:46-02:51; 03:05-03:08; 02:33-02:37]. \n\nIn summary, while the video does not provide explicit instructions on adjusting crutches, it highlights the importance of proper positioning and balance during use, which is crucial for effective mobility and safety.",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

That's where that rotator cuff comes in. So again, what you're looking at here, this is my right shoulder blade. Looks just like that with the humorous, the arm bone hanging down right here. You've got four muscles that come off of your shoulder blade. Three of them come from the back, one of them comes from the front. And then you can see that they kind of wrap around the head of that humorous to form a cuff around it. Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade. It needs to be seated in the right location and it needs to stay in that right location throughout movement as we're going through this motion.

Place both crutches underneath the opposite side.

When standing, the top of the crutches should be about one to two inches below your armpits. This allows for proper support without causing discomfort.\n\n3. **Grip the Hand Grips**: Reach down for the hand grips of the crutches while ensuring they are positioned comfortably under your arms. Your elbows should be slightly bent when holding the grips [Video 1].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: When transitioning from standing to sitting, back up to the chair or bed until you feel it against your unaffected leg.

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it. Most of the time, you should be able to get rid of the pain by doing what I've shown you. If not, come in for a visit. The sooner you come in, the easier it is to treat and the faster you get better. If it persists for several weeks or more, then it becomes more difficult to treat and you can take a longer day of better.

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all.

The idea is you do these throughout the day and that's why we usually pick one and usually why it only wants to take 30 seconds. You take 30 seconds out of your day and do the stretch real quick and then move on and you're going to have better results by spreading out over the day instead of doing one long workout or stretch.

Ensure your back is flat and your pelvis is not raised above the floor, as this indicates tightness that needs addressing [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 06:41-06:42].\n\n2. **Cat Position**: Slowly arch your back upwards towards the ceiling, tucking your chin towards your chest. This position stretches the spine and helps relieve tension.\n\n3. **Camel Position**: Next, gently lower your back towards the floor while lifting your head and tailbone upwards. This creates a gentle extension in your spine.\n\n4. **Range of Motion**: Work within a comfortable range that does not cause pain. If you find yourself unable to go into full extension, stop at a point where you feel a gentle stretch without discomfort [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Perform this sequence slowly, repeating it several times, focusing on your breathing and maintaining control throughout the movements.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always listen to your body and avoid pushing into painful",

Do this 20 to 30 reps on each direction and also repeat it three to four sets, owner and radial distractions. Grab the end of the wrist with the other hand and slightly pull the wrist joint apart. This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints.

For example, gymnastics, yoga, Olympic weightlifting, woodworking, or any repetitive strain in juicing tasks such as desewer, body weighted wrist stretches. To stretch the wrist flexors, find a table or bench that plays the palm of your hand on top of the table and lean and body weight on them. This should create a slight stretch already. If you still don't feel the stretch, slightly lean forward with your body weight until you feel a slight stretch, the back of your wrist or in the inner portion of your forearm. Now if you don't feel any pain or severe pain, you are now ready to lean side to side. Nice and slow. This will mobilize the wrist and wrist extension and also stretch out the wrist flex muscle. To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm.

So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

This helps target the muscle rather than the knee joint, which can alleviate discomfort during the stretch [Video 2: r21kAatSVqc, Time: 04:28-04:32].\n\n3. **Stretching**: Gently lean forward into the stretch to feel a pull in the quadriceps and hip flexors of the kneeling leg. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds, ensuring you maintain a gentle stretch without causing pain.\n\n4. **Listen to Your Body**: If you experience pain in your knee during the stretch, stop immediately. Pain may indicate an underlying issue, and it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional [Video 1: r21kAatSVqc, Time: 04:40-04:46].\n\n5. **Repetition**: Repeat the",

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

Ensure your wrists are aligned under your shoulders and your knees under your hips.\n\n2. **Leg Positioning**: Bring your right knee forward and place it behind your right wrist. Your right foot should be angled towards your left hip. Extend your left leg straight back behind you, keeping your hips square to the ground.\n\n3. **Lowering Your Body**: Gradually lower your torso towards the ground, resting on your forearms or extending your arms fully in front of you. Focus on feeling the stretch in your hips and glutes, not in your knee. If you experience knee pain, adjust your position or stop the stretch, as this may indicate a problem that requires medical attention [Video 1: r21kAatSVqc, Time: 04:40-04:46].\n\n4. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for 20-30 seconds, breathing deeply. Repeat on the other side.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you feel pain in your knee rather than a stretch in your hips, adjust your leg position or consult a doctor, as this could",

It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's",

Ensure your hands are washed thoroughly with soap and dried with a lint-free towel to avoid contamination [Video 1: GZsHRoAXj3Y, Time: 01:09-01:21].\n\n2. **Open the Lens Case**: At night before bed, open your contact lens case to access the cleaned ortho-k lenses [Video 2: GZsHRoAXj3Y, Time: 01:38-01:43].\n\n3. **Apply Saline Solution**: Place one or two drops of saline solution into the lens bowl. This helps to keep the lens moist and facilitates easier insertion [Video 3: GZsHRoAXj3Y, Time: 01:53-02:00].\n\n4. **Insert the Lens**: Carefully pick up the lens with your fingertip, ensuring it is facing down. Gently insert the lens into your eye. It\u2019s important to let the lens settle properly after insertion.\n\n5. **Eyelid Positioning**",

Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock.

Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to",

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it,",

That means that it's your back is so tight that it actually does need stretching. So you just work in the range that allows you. And then eventually you might be able to go up this far. If you're still coming off like this, go up to the point where it allows you to go and stop right there and go back down again.

Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

This gentle movement helps to alleviate stiffness and can reduce pain. It's important to move cautiously and stop if you experience any pain during this process [Video 2: 00:22-00:29].\n\n2. **Neck Circles**: After side bends, gently roll your head in a circular motion. This can help work out any knots that may be contributing to your discomfort [Video 2: 00:22-00:29].\n\n3. **Heat and Cold Therapy**: Alternate between applying a cold compress and a heating pad for 20 minutes each. This method can help reduce swelling and numb pain, providing relief [Video 2: 00:22-00:29].\n\n4. **Avoid Stiffness**: It\u2019s crucial not to avoid moving your neck altogether, as this can lead to increased stiffness and prolonged pain. Keeping the neck mobile is essential for recovery [Video 1: 00:41-00:43].\n\n5. **Seek Help if Necessary**: If you experience pain, numbness, or ting",

Try taking a hot shower since the steam of water can help massage your neck and relax your muscles.

If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side.

So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions.

So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises.

So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin, and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little paws come back in and relax and reset myself. So again, you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations. But if you can get it right, you're really gonna get that stiffness out of there. So it works really, really well. So the next one is gonna just be a levator scapula stretch. And that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there.

This gentle motion can help alleviate stiffness and discomfort. Be cautious and stop if you experience any pain during this movement [Video 2: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29].\n\n2. **Neck Circles**: After side rocking, gently roll your head in a circular motion. This can assist in working out any knots that may be contributing to your discomfort [Video 2].\n\n3. **Heat and Cold Therapy**: Alternate between applying a cold compress and a heating pad to your neck for 20 minutes each. This method can help reduce swelling and numb pain, providing additional relief [Video 2].\n\n4. **Avoid Stiffness**: It\u2019s important not to avoid moving your neck altogether, as this can lead to increased stiffness and prolonged pain [Video 1: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 00:41-00:43].\n\n5. **Seek Help if Necessary**: If you experience pain, numbness, or tingling that radi",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics.

Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here.

If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it. Most of the time, you should be able to get rid of the pain by doing what I've shown you. If not, come in for a visit. The sooner you come in, the easier it is to treat and the faster you get better. If it persists for several weeks or more, then it becomes more difficult to treat and you can take a longer day of better.

Apply a light pressure with your hand to enhance the stretch. Hold this position for 30 seconds. Repeat this stretch three times on each side to promote flexibility and reduce stiffness [Video 2: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 01:01-01:07].\n\n2. **Avoid Immobilization**: It\u2019s crucial not to avoid movement altogether, as this can lead to increased stiffness and prolonged pain. Movement is essential for recovery [Video 1: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 00:41-00:43].\n\n3. **Monitor Symptoms**: While performing these stretches, if you experience pain, numbness, or tingling that radiates down your arm and hand, proceed with caution. In such cases, consider using techniques like the McKenzie method, which is designed for more complex neck issues [Video 3: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 03:59-04:00].\n\nAlways listen to your body and consult a healthcare",

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there.

Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow.

This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest. To stretch the forearm muscles for golfers elbow, you're going to exaggerate a very slow wave so that palm of your hand lands on the table top and bench where your fingers point backwards. Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos.

So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side. That's not a bad thing, but we can make it better if we get the towel and maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter. You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note",

Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there.

Typically, the pain is felt on the outer part of the elbow, often radiating down into the forearm, accompanied by some muscle tightness in that area [Video 1: Mtd0U13cfx0, Time: 00:46-00:50]. \n\nNext, consider how the pain began. Tennis elbow often develops gradually due to repetitive motions or overuse, particularly in activities that involve gripping or wrist extension. \n\nFor a more hands-on assessment, you can perform a wrist extension stretch. Place the back of your hand on a table with your elbow straight and locked. Lean backward gently with your body weight until you feel a stretch in the back of your hand or wrist. Ensure that you do not experience severe pain during this stretch [Video 2: hJ3XICFLxvU, Time: 03:58-04:03]. \n\nIf you feel discomfort or severe pain during these assessments, it is advisable to stop and consult a healthcare professional for a comprehensive evaluation.",

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting.

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos.

Typically, pain is felt on the outer part of the elbow, which may extend down into the forearm. Look for any tightness in the muscles around this area [Video 1: Mtd0U13cfx0, Time: 00:46-00:50].\n\n2. **Assess Pain Trigger**: Consider how the pain started. Tennis elbow often results from repetitive activities involving gripping, twisting, or pulling motions, especially with the wrist in an extended position, such as typing on a computer for prolonged periods [Video 2: Mtd0U13cfx0, Time: 00:55-00:57].\n\n3. **Perform a Resistance Test**: Hold your arm out straight in front of you, keeping your wrist straight. Use your other hand to apply gentle pressure to the middle finger while trying to push down. If this causes pain in the elbow area, it may indicate tennis elbow.\n\n4. **Safety Note**: Ensure that you perform these tests slowly and without forcing any movements to avoid exacerbating any potential",

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

      "answer": "To alleviate forearm pain, you can perform a simple stretching exercise. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by placing the palm of your hand flat on a tabletop or bench, with your fingers pointing backward. Ensure your elbow is fully extended and straight.\n\n2. **Leaning Back**: Slowly lean your body weight backward while keeping your hand in place. This action will create a stretch in the inner part of your forearm and the back of your wrist.\n\n3. **Feeling the Stretch**: As you lean back, you should feel a gentle stretch. It\u2019s important to do this slowly to avoid any sudden strain on your muscles.\n\n4. **Duration**: Hold the stretch for a few seconds, then return to the starting position. Repeat this process several times to help alleviate the pain.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you do not push yourself too hard; the stretch should be comfortable and not cause pain. If you experience significant discomfort, stop the exercise immediately [Video 1: hJ3XICFLxvU, Time: 05:19-05:24].",

To go down, you go down with your crutches first, then your injured leg comes forward, And you put the weight through your hands to step with your left foot. One step at a time. So I'll always remember to follow your doctor's orders as far as how much weight you can put through your injured leg. But if you keep things to remember when using crutches will help you heal and get home safely. Remember not to lean your armpits onto the top of the crutches. Remember to always stand tall and you're",

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

      "answer": "To perform tabletop stretches effectively, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Workspace**: Find a sturdy table or bench where you can comfortably place your hands. Ensure the surface is clean and free of obstacles.\n\n2. **Stretching the Wrist Flexors**: Place the palm of your hand on the table with your fingers pointing towards your body. Lean your body weight onto your hand to deepen the stretch. This position helps stretch the wrist flexors, which is beneficial for activities that require wrist strength, such as gymnastics or weightlifting [Video 1: hJ3XICFLxvU, Time: 03:25-03:29].\n\n3. **Stretching the Wrist Extensors**: To target the wrist extensors, extend your arm with the palm facing down and fingers pointing downwards. Gently pull your hand back towards your body while keeping your arm straight and elbow locked. This will help promote wrist flexion and effectively stretch the extensors [Video 1: hJ3XICFLxvU, Time: 03:07-03:09].\n\n**Safety Notes**: Ensure that you do not overstretch, as this can lead to injury. Perform these stretches in a controlled manner,",

I just have tight ankles because I've sprained them both, but just having that little bit of an incline really helps be able to bring it back there without having that ankle issues. So. And then going uphill direction does put a little more emphasis on quad strength. So that's another benefit. The other really nice thing about it is you can use this for pre-hab.

The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing range of motion after surgery. Oftentimes, it's a very next day. You've got to get that joint moving. There will be maybe some instances where that's not the case, but total need is almost always. And this works great.

Mike is filling on the in-force and we're happy to have him. and we're going to continue on in the title of this video is the best niece drink fitting exercise after surgery and that's including total knee, meniscus or ACL surgery plus the giveaway and the giveaway relates directly to this video or we have but yes you can check us out on Instagram, twitter and tiktok for a 60 second version of our program you can find the giveaway pinned to the top of our Facebook or go to bumbright.com slash giveaways to find out what it is. Giveaways the knee glide. Yes, which you're going to find out how useful this can be for after surgery as well as before surgery. So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works",

Because they're not in control. then people don't feel comfortable and somebody else is in control of a painful joint. Mike, you got some more comments on that aspect of the knee glide? Yeah, flat is okay to do. I feel like when I get here, it gets tied on my ankles. I just have tight ankles because I've sprained them both, but just having that little bit of an incline really helps be able to bring it back there without having that ankle issues. So. And then going uphill direction does put a little more emphasis on quad strength. So that's another benefit. The other really nice thing about it is you can use this for pre-hab. So before surgery, we have some surgeons and people that will use it prior. So they get used to the equipment, it get that knee moving. And to be honest with you, people say, I use this more. The towel kind of works, but I actually have a piece of equipment here. And I'm the compliance and the ability or the motivation to use this as much higher than the towel. Not the mention it works so much better. We've started sending these out with all our total knee replacement people. We send them home because we keep numerous ones at our locations and they all love it. And they just when they're done",

Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing range of motion after surgery. Oftentimes, it's a very next day. You've got to get that joint moving. There will be maybe some instances where that's not the case, but total need is almost always. And this works great. Your knee hurts at sore, but you got to get it moving. and you get it going and on the flat. Now, Mike has his at an angle where he's gonna emphasize the hamstring strength. This might not be early on, this would be more for strength and then later on down the river. Maybe a couple of weeks, three weeks down the road. As you can do it this way, we find that when you put it on an incline, this direction works really well right after that,",

Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

Ensure your knee is positioned comfortably, possibly at a slight angle to facilitate movement. This positioning helps in reducing strain on the joint while allowing for effective gliding [Video 1: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 02:56-02:58].\n\n2. **Gentle Movement**: Begin to gently glide your heel towards your buttocks and then back down. This motion should be slow and controlled to avoid pain or discomfort. The goal is to encourage movement in the knee joint without forcing it [Video 1: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 02:56-02:58].\n\n3. **Frequency**: Aim to perform this exercise multiple times a day, especially the day after surgery, as early movement is crucial for recovery. It is important to listen to your body and not push through severe pain, as some soreness is expected but sharp pain should be avoided [Video 1: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 02:56-02:58].\n\n4. **Consultation**: Always consult with",

There will be maybe some instances where that's not the case, but total need is almost always. And this works great. Your knee hurts at sore, but you got to get it moving. and you get it going and on the flat. Now, Mike has his at an angle where he's gonna emphasize the hamstring strength. This might not be early on, this would be more for strength and then later on down the river. Maybe a couple of weeks, three weeks down the road. As you can do it this way, we find that when you put it on an incline, this direction works really well right after that, first week after surgery. For one thing, you're going downhill, makes it easier. It changes the angle of the ankle joint. And for some reason, we're not 100% certain, but we always have better luck when you put it on an incline if someone's having problems. We have the patient go like this with their strong leg, put a little passive range. We always find that people get better range when they do the pressure versus the therapist going on their question. She's shoving it in the right. Because they're not in control. then people don't feel comfortable and somebody else is in control of a painful joint. Mike, you got some more comments on that aspect of the knee glide? Yeah, flat is okay to do. I",

Yes, which you're going to find out how useful this can be for after surgery as well as before surgery. So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

She's shoving it in the right. Because they're not in control. then people don't feel comfortable and somebody else is in control of a painful joint. Mike, you got some more comments on that aspect of the knee glide? Yeah, flat is okay to do. I feel like when I get here, it gets tied on my ankles. I just have tight ankles because I've sprained them both, but just having that little bit of an incline really helps be able to bring it back there without having that ankle issues. So. And then going uphill direction does put a little more emphasis on quad strength. So that's another benefit. The other really nice thing about it is you can use this for pre-hab. So before surgery, we have some surgeons and people that will use it prior. So they get used to the equipment, it get that knee moving. And to be honest with you, people say, I use this more.

There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work.

Yeah, flat is okay to do. I feel like when I get here, it gets tied on my ankles. I just have tight ankles because I've sprained them both, but just having that little bit of an incline really helps be able to bring it back there without having that ankle issues. So. And then going uphill direction does put a little more emphasis on quad strength. So that's another benefit. The other really nice thing about it is you can use this for pre-hab. So before surgery, we have some surgeons and people that will use it prior. So they get used to the equipment, it get that knee moving. And to be honest with you, people say, I use this more. The towel kind of works, but I actually have a piece of equipment here. And I'm the compliance and the ability or the motivation to use this as much higher than the towel. Not the mention it works so much better. We've started sending these out with all our total knee replacement people. We send them home because we keep numerous ones at our locations and they all love it. And they just when they're done",

So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing range of motion after surgery. Oftentimes, it's a very next day. You've got to get that joint moving. There will be maybe some instances where that's not the case, but total need is almost always. And this works great. Your knee hurts at sore, but you got to get it moving. and you get it going and on the flat. Now, Mike has his",

An incline can be beneficial for emphasizing hamstring strength, particularly a few weeks post-surgery [Video 1: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 03:17-03:18].\n\n2. **Initial Movement**: Begin gently moving your knee through its range of motion. This is crucial as it helps to alleviate soreness and promotes healing. Start this movement as early as the day after surgery, if advised by your healthcare provider [Video 1: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 02:56-02:58].\n\n3. **Progress to Strengthening**: After a week or so, as your recovery progresses, you can focus more on strengthening exercises using the knee glide. Ensure that your movements are controlled and within a comfortable range to avoid strain.\n\n4. **Monitor Pain Levels**: While using the knee glide, pay attention to any pain or discomfort. If you experience significant pain, stop and consult your healthcare provider.\n\nAlways follow your surgeon's or physical therapist's guidelines to ensure safe and",
