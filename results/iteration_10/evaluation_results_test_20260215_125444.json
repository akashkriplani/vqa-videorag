If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all. And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key. So I'm going to go through a couple steps and show you exactly how this is done. I also want to tell you that this far is protected where and gear. Some people will deck out in everything including a gown, gloves, mask. I sheelts, typically in my setting the respiratory therapist, text, doctor's nurses. We all just put all the pair of gloves. If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face",

Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the",

I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those. It's a top three exercises for neck pain and posture.",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it, but that's where your problem comes from AC joint. It could also also be a bit of osteoarthritis, you need to be really a bit older for that, maybe having had a drum and a past in your shoulder, a lot of grinding goes on, I'm not talking about the occasional clicking when you move your arm, but it's the grinding stuff, that is a bit of a telltale sign as well as osteoarthritis, and you can have an appingement, an appingement is actually one of the tendons within the shoulder joint in the area, which get impeached. So when your shoulder decreases its space and the tendon becomes stuck essentially. Now the test you can do for that on the right side is literally put your right",

You could put two in it at the same time or double up the resistance. Yep. And the thing about that is, yeah, now it's going to be really tough here. I just got it on two of them or one of them here. And that one is really working now. Right. Yeah, so you can get plenty of resistance. I don't care how tough you are. So the product that I really like, Brad, is this Digi Flex.

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10 rotation before moving to the next spot.

I have the person helping you position the felt back pad behind your shoulder blades with the plastic triangle pointing down. Have them carefully wrap the left strap over your left shoulder and under your armpit.

The brace should now be in a figure 8 shape. To adjust Just the fit, the person helping to pull the straps tighter or loosen the straps until your desired level of clavicle or posture support is reached. Make sure they adjust one strap by time to prevent further injury. Once on and properly adjusted, you should feel your shoulders being gently pulled back.

If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here.

      "answer": "To put on a clavicle brace, start by unfolding the brace and laying it flat to identify the left and right straps. Position the felt back pad behind your shoulder blades, ensuring the plastic triangle points downward. A helper should then wrap the left strap over your left shoulder and under your armpit, securing it with the Velcro closure. Next, thread the end of the left strap through the left side of the plastic triangle buckle and attach the Velcro closure. Repeat this process for the right strap, ensuring the brace is now in a figure-eight shape [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 01:21-01:35].\n\nOnce the brace is in place, you can adjust the fit by pulling the straps tighter or loosening them until you achieve the desired level of clavicle and posture support [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 01:31-01:35]. This brace is essential for stabilizing the clavicle area after a fracture, promoting proper healing while maintaining shoulder alignment [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 00:46-00:49].",

          "text": "pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus.

One of the things to know What you insert the swab is to go in a horizontal configuration to the patient's head. You can see on this diagram behind me and I'll use my swab as a pointer that you're actually going horizontally. You're not going vertically. You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area. If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all.

And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists of nerves and blood vessels and it runs essentially from your neck into your shoulder and it can be compressed here, it can be compressed by a muscle or can be compressed by the clavicle or it can be compressed by the first rape even.

This helps in making the patient comfortable and cooperative [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:22-01:36].\n\n2. **Locate the Nodes**: The supraclavicular lymph nodes are located above the clavicle in the supraclavicular fossa. Position your fingers in this area to begin the examination [Video 2].\n\n3. **Bilateral Examination**: Use both hands to palpate deeply inside the supraclavicular fossae on both sides. This bilateral approach allows for a thorough assessment of any potential masses or abnormalities [Video 2].\n\n4. **Assess Features**: While palpating, feel for any unusual characteristics of the nodes, such as size, consistency, and tenderness. This is crucial for identifying any pathological changes [Video 1].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always ensure that the patient is comfortable and relaxed during the examination to avoid any discomfort or anxiety. Communicate clearly throughout the process to maintain trust [Video 2].\n\nBy following these steps,",

In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

So I typically prefer this shaft over the lower one bed both work equally well as far as picking up a sample. One of the things to know What you insert the swab is to go in a horizontal configuration to the patient's head. You can see on this diagram behind me and I'll use my swab as a pointer that you're actually going horizontally. You're not going vertically. You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area. If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all. And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key. So",

Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa.

The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used.

The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally.

This helps in building trust and comfort during the examination [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:22-01:36].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Position your hands to apply direct pressure underneath the patient's chin. This area is where the submental lymph nodes are located [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:48-01:56].\n\n3. **Examination Technique**: Use both hands to palpate the area gently. Feel for any masses or nodes, assessing their size, consistency, and tenderness. It is important to be thorough and systematic in your examination [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:48-01:56].\n\n4. **Differentiation**: Be aware that the submental lymph nodes are separate from the submandibular lymph nodes, which run along the jawline. This distinction is crucial for accurate assessment [Video 3: _N89T_Yqu68, Time:",

In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is",

One of the things to know What you insert the swab is to go in a horizontal configuration to the patient's head. You can see on this diagram behind me and I'll use my swab as a pointer that you're actually going horizontally. You're not going vertically. You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area. If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all.

The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those. It's a top three exercises for neck pain and posture.",

And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate.

And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury.

We know how L5 was down at the top of your foot if you feel symptoms there, right? So where you're having the pain, it could be where you're having the pinched nerve but quite often it isn't.

You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a",

Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this.

These nodes are situated anterior to the ear.\n\n3. **Examine the Postauricular Nodes**: Move your fingers to the area just behind the ear, applying gentle pressure. This is where the postauricular lymph nodes are located.\n\n4. **Bilateral Examination**: It\u2019s important to examine both sides of the head to compare findings.

In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined.

It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all. And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key.

Some people will deck out in everything including a gown, gloves, mask. I sheelts, typically in my setting the respiratory therapist, text, doctor's nurses. We all just put all the pair of gloves. If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face",

This is really where the partial head here.

One of the common areas that can get pinched is right when it's coming out of these holes here, right, right in that spot here. As you get older, you want to zoom in and, Brad, can you kind of point out? Okay, so the nerves are never, or not, a half inch lot of like I've heard they actually, the nerves are here. Hold on. I fell down into your arm. The nerves in this area will wrap around your chest and the ones that I hear go down in your legs.

When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways to reduce neck pain.

That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to strengthen your lower back muscles is to actually train them with your hips. One of my favorite ways to do that at home is with some bridges. Let's go ahead and get started, lay down on your back with both of your knees bent. What I'm going to do now is contract your glutes, squeeze your butt. together and then use that contraction to lift your hips off floor again the emphasis is right here in the butt muscles in those blue muscles we're going to hold this for about three to five seconds and then we're going to come right back now keep in mind the higher you go the more chance that it has to be irritating to your lower back go up as high as",

Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

Begin by positioning yourself behind the patient to access the occipital region effectively. \n\n1. **Locate the Occipital Area**: The occipital lymph nodes are situated at the back of the head, just above the nape of the neck. \n\n2. **Use Both Hands**: Employ both hands to palpate the area gently. This allows for a more thorough examination and helps in comparing both sides for any asymmetry or abnormalities.\n\n3. **Apply Gentle Pressure**: Use your fingers to apply gentle pressure in a circular motion to feel for any enlarged nodes or masses. You should be feeling for characteristics such as tenderness, size, and consistency of the nodes.\n\n4. **Assess Bilaterally**: Ensure to examine both sides of the occipital region to identify any potential discrepancies between the two sides.\n\n5. **Communicate with the Patient**: Throughout the examination, maintain communication with the patient to ensure their comfort and to inquire about any tenderness or pain during palpation.\n\nAlways remember to wash your hands before and after the examination to maintain hygiene [Video 1: _N",

Anyways, she went to the college. We kept her awake many nights from our snoring. Not just me, but my wife as well. And so it's a problem. So, why do you snore? It happens because when you fall asleep, the muscles in your throat, they relax, and with open mouth breathing, it starts to get these vibrations, and you know, it can be like, my dad was just as a chainsaw, you know? All right. How many cords would you cut last night, dad? Yeah, I had a friend that stayed in our cabin. It was, it was unreal. It was a phenomena. I mean, did you hand out your plugs? Oh, I mean, I had door shut, and you could hear him. I mean, Yeah, I mean, I think the towel is complaining. Yeah, we don't want to talk about it, right? So I would make the news.

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

Come back up, take a breather, and then repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, go down just a little bit more stretch into it, challenge those muscles to open up those joints.

I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down.

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Ensure that your head is aligned with your spine and not dropping forward, as this can exacerbate neck tension and lead to a neck hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n2. **Chin Tuck**: Gently tuck your chin in towards your chest. This action helps maintain proper alignment of your cervical spine and reduces the strain on your neck [Video 1].\n\n3. **Upper Body Engagement**: Push your upper body through your arms while keeping your chin tucked. This engages your upper back muscles and helps counteract the forward head posture that contributes to neck tension [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n4. **Pressure Application**: If you have a book or a similar object, hold it above your chest while maintaining the chin tuck. This creates pressure that can help flatten any existing neck hump by engaging the muscles from multiple directions [Video 2: fsdch",

And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists of nerves and blood vessels and it runs essentially from your neck into your shoulder and it can be compressed here, it can be compressed by a muscle or can be compressed by the clavicle or it can be compressed by the first rape even.

So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can. And we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet. So even after you blow it out and you feel like you may be empty, I'll still coach it a key, blow and keep pushing, keep going, keep going, and then after a few seconds, I'll ask you to take another fast, you bet that again, and then I'll ask you to come off the mouthpiece.

We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs. Where are from the back to the legs are you getting a pinch of hair and which we use you call sciatica sure The other thing we thought we talked about a couple fun ones right, Brad With this some names out there for nerves that could pinched and these are the ones that are",

We know how L5 was down at the top of your foot if you feel symptoms there, right? So where you're having the pain, it could be where you're having the pinched nerve but quite often it isn't. It's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here kind of trying to kind of investigate of the job trying to figure out where the problem is coming from. So let's talk about a couple of some of the common areas where you might have a pinched nerve. Nancy could be at the spine right away. Who's catching? Okay. Okay. We've got our spine here. This is really where the partial head here. These are the bones that stack up to make your back, you know, within the bones itself there's a canal and that's your spinal cord and coming off the spinal cord are these nerves All right, these are the nerves that can get compressed or pinched, all right? One of the common areas that can get pinched is right when it's coming out of these holes here, right, right in that spot here. As you get older, you want to zoom in and, Brad, can you kind of point out? Okay, so the nerves are never, or not, a half inch lot of like I've heard they actually, the nerves are here. Hold on.

So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome.

Yeah, put pressure on the specific nerve. And that nerve will send symptoms, wherver that nerve tracks, and here they go down into the way. And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if",

      "answer": "To identify if you may have a pinched nerve, particularly in the context of shoulder pain, you can follow these steps based on the provided video evidence:\n\n1. **Assess Pain Location**: Begin by determining if you experience pain in your shoulder that seems to originate from your neck. A pinched nerve, particularly in the cervical region, can cause referred pain to the shoulder area.\n\n2. **Identify Symptoms**: Pay attention to any shooting pain that radiates from your neck into your shoulder. This symptom is indicative of a condition known as radiculopathy, which occurs when a nerve is compressed in the neck [Video 1: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time: 01:30-01:35].\n\n3. **Monitor Additional Symptoms**: Alongside shoulder pain, you may experience numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arm or hand, which can also suggest nerve involvement.\n\n4. **Seek Professional Evaluation**: If you notice these symptoms, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and appropriate diagnostic imaging if necessary.\n\nRemember, early identification and intervention can prevent further complications related to nerve compression.",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

      "answer": "To identify if you may have Saturday night palsy, observe the following signs and symptoms. Saturday night palsy typically occurs when pressure is applied to the radial nerve, often from sleeping in a position that compresses the arm, such as resting it on a hard surface. \n\n1. **Numbness or Weakness**: You may experience numbness or weakness in the arm, particularly in the wrist and hand. This can manifest as difficulty in extending the wrist or fingers.\n   \n2. **Positioning**: Consider if you have fallen asleep in a position that could compress your arm, such as over a chair or bar. This is a common scenario leading to this condition. \n\n3. **Waking Symptoms**: Upon waking, if you notice that you cannot move your arm or if it feels \"dead\" or limp, this could indicate radial nerve palsy. \n\n4. **Duration**: Symptoms usually resolve after changing positions and relieving pressure, but if they persist, medical attention may be necessary. \n\nFor more information, refer to the description of Saturday night palsy in [Video 3: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].",

To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can. And we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet. So even after you blow it out and you feel like you may be empty, I'll",

You wake up in your arms. You can't move your arms. No, they cut off so much that the nurse can not fire the muscles. I never experienced that you are disallent at all. But no, it would be how do you move palsy? You fall asleep with your honies on your arm like this? Yeah, it's like your honey. Yeah, this is my honey. And all I'm longing, you're afraid to get away from her, and there's a joke too about non-hoffware or whatever. That also causes a pausing in your arm.

Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet.

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch",

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

      "answer": "To prevent your foot from falling asleep while driving, you can perform specific exercises that enhance circulation and strengthen your foot muscles. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Ankle Rolls**: While seated, roll your ankles outwards and then inwards. This movement helps improve blood flow to your feet. \n\n2. **Heel Lifts**: Push the balls of your feet into the ground while lifting your heels up. This action engages your calf muscles, which can help prevent numbness. Visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot during this exercise. Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions for 3 to 4 sets [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 02:02-02:08].\n\n3. **Foot Rolling**: Sit in a chair and place a lacrosse or massage ball on the ground. Position the sole of your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over it, focusing on tender areas. This technique can relieve tension and improve circulation [Video 2: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 05:57-06:02].\n\n4. **Consistency**: Incorporate these exercises regularly, as they can enhance your foot's",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight.

And my raising arms up again hand palms facing And now hold this again for 10 seconds, repeat five times and that really mobilizes and strengthens the area, the lower part of your neck area. Now it's quite an intense exercise. If you're struggling to hold each position for 10 seconds, repeat five times, what you do is do the A first for 10 seconds, then you move to the T, then you move to the Y, you hold each about 10 seconds and you give yourself a rest. I do 80 y again. A brilliant exercise to reduce the neck hump. Just a quick one. If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels.

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

I hope these exercises and stretches help you as much as they helped me and my patients. Kind of raises with a ball. Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

So you got, this is one of the easiest ones, and you can see I can get all the fingers, and we're working on extending, working on extending the fingers, and you can get more resistance by using a heavier band. the darker the color typically and that's weighters on these on this product. The darker the color the more resistance. And you simply it takes a little time to change the rubber band also we're not going to do that. And you have to necessarily change it. You could put two in it at the same time or double up the resistance. Yep. And the thing about that is, yeah, now it's going to be really tough here. I just got it on two of them or one of them here. And that one is really working now. Right. Yeah, so you can get plenty of resistance. I don't care how tough you are. So the product that I really like, Brad, is this Digi Flex. It's called multi-progressive exercise system. This is really cool. And the reason it's really cool. Now",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

A spacer or holding chamber is an attachment that should always be used with your inhaler. The spacer holds the medicine in place so you can breathe it in easier. Now, let's demonstrate how to correctly use a spacer in mouthpiece. First, remove the cap from the bottom of your inhaler. When you get your new inhaler from the pharmacy, you need to prime or waste it by spraying the medicine into the air four times. Now, fit your inhaler into the opening at the end of the spacer. Shake the inhaler well for 10 seconds. Turn your head to the side and breathe out. Close mouth around mouthpiece of spacer. Push down on the inhaler once. Now the medicine is inside the spacer. Right away, take a slow, deep breath. The goal is not to hear a whistling sound. If you do, this means that you're breathing in too fast. Hold your breath for a count of 10. Now slowly breathe out. Rinse your mouth out with water, or brush teeth, or get a drink after using controller medicines, such as inhaled steroids. Many times, the correct dose of your medicine will be to inhaled two puffs. If this is what is prescribed for you, then wait one minute after the first puff, and then follow all of the steps again. Remember, if you have",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So you got, this is one of the easiest ones, and you can see I can get all the fingers, and we're working on extending, working on extending the fingers, and you can get more resistance by using a heavier band. the darker the color typically and that's weighters on these on this product. The darker the color the more resistance. And you simply it takes a little time to change the rubber band also we're not going to do that. And you have to necessarily change it. You could put two in it at the same time or double up the resistance. Yep. And the thing about that is, yeah, now it's going to be really tough here. I just got it on two of them or one of them here. And that one is really working now. Right. Yeah, so you can get plenty of resistance. I don't care how tough you are. So the product that I really like, Brad, is this Digi Flex.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like",

You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade.

Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10 rotation before moving to the next spot. Because if you do have short issues, check out my fix my round the shoulder video, or even mobilise the shoulders with a power bag.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels.

Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

I hope these exercises and stretches help you as much as they helped me and my patients. Kind of raises with a ball. Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets.

Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

It was no doubt about it. All right, next one. It's the timer, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's right. OK. Next one, we're going to go ahead and last one. You're going to do what we call finger abduction. So you're bringing the finger out like this. Now that my hand is warmed up from the wax lab, I'm going to try with this hand. Oh, look at that. It is amazing. Yeah. It's even with a healthy hand, you could feel much more movable. Look at the air theme on there. By the way, unfortunately, by time this video is aired, We are giving away one of these on Facebook, which is another reason to like us on Facebook.

Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or as a review, when you breathe in, your abdomen is actually expanding. And that opens up the diaphragm. So when Brad breathes in, you can see how it is expanding when he breathes out, it actually goes down. That's the opposite of what people quite often think. A lot of times they think, but breathing my chest should go out, but it's actually you want your diaphragm to go out. So if I have quick breaths, and then we can go on and start the exercises. So the first one, just to kind of get a little movement for the abdomen here, where actually just going to do kind of flexing forward here for five times. I'm sorry, these are all 10 to 15 times actually. Let's stick with 15. OK, 15 times. So you just kind of come forward a little bit here. Very easy to do. 15 times. We'll say we're up to 15, all right? Sure. So we're going to put it all along. Number two, you're actually going to rotate the trunk using your hips. So Brad's going to go ahead and do that.

You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key.

Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a link right here.

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

If you need to cleanse, use a gentle low pH cleanser and do not scrub at any lines drawn on your skin. Moisturizer can help your skin heal more quickly after treatment. Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a link right here.

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your",

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight.

From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to strengthen your lower back muscles is to actually train them with your hips. One of my favorite ways to do that at home is with some bridges. Let's go ahead and get started, lay down on your back with both of your knees bent. What I'm going to do now is contract your glutes, squeeze your butt. together and then use that contraction to",

I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations.

My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So for demonstrated purposes, I will be using my can of soup. So if you are using the soup can, just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like this and then roll it up and you kind of have a homemade foam roller. So there I'm just going to position it right on the upper back. So I just go",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump. Often people who experience a neck hump or a buffalo hump also experience a bit of neck pain as well. I've done some",

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight.

From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated.

And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated. We're also going to start off on our knees, so make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath them for extra comfort. Let's go right up to that flat elevated surface. I'm going to bend the arm like this and place the back side of my arms flat on that elevated surface. Let's press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor point. My hands, they're going",

This will create a passive stretch into the upper back, and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click, or crack. Again, that is just gas is being released from the joints. You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back.

I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder the other side shoulder When you do this you'll really feel it open up into the neck right here and a lot of times You'll get a sudden pop crack or release into the neck or into the upper back It usually feels really good again with this one don't try to force it You want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds you're just going to relax and then on the next repetition drive the arm over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the shoulder even more get a better stretch each time and I would do this on both sides to keep them in balance.

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So for demonstrated purposes, I will be using my can of soup. So if you are using the soup can, just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like this and then roll it up and you kind of have a homemade foam roller. So there I'm just going to position it right on the upper back. So I just go",

For a more advanced version, elevate your elbows to shoulder level with your forearms parallel to the ground [Video 2].\n\n3. **Lean In**: Gently lean into the corner, allowing your body to stretch. Be cautious not to force the movement; lean lightly to avoid injury [Video 2].\n\n4. **Engage Your Body**: As you lean, you may feel a stretch in your upper back and trapezius area. To enhance the stretch, you can rotate your upper body slightly away from the wall, which may produce a pop or crack as you release tension [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 08:14-08:19].\n\n5. **Listen to Your Body**: If",

From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards the left. From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump.

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm",

I'm going to repeat this. What you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little bit differently. So experiment with different angles. Go all the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the left. If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders.

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

Do a nice slow controlled breathing also. Let that tension out, the more you're relaxed, the more results that you're gonna get with this. From there, I'm just going to relax. Come back up, take a breather, and then repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, go down just a little bit more stretch into it, challenge those muscles to open up those joints. And if it is locked up, you might get a sudden pop crack or self release. With this one too, what I'm going to do is then take it to the next level by just angling my body out a little bit towards one side. So in this case, I'm going to little bit towards my right. I'm going to repeat this. What you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little bit differently. So experiment with different angles. Go all the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the left. If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show",

Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

This will be your support structure for the stretch [Video 2].\n\n2. **Position Your Body**: Stand facing the corner and place your forearms against the wall at shoulder height. Ensure your elbows are up and your forearms are parallel to the floor for a more advanced version of the stretch [Video 2: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 02:38-02:42].\n\n3. **Lean In**: Gently lean your body into the corner. Keep your eyes level and maintain a slight bend in your knees for stability. This leaning motion will help open up your chest and stretch the upper back [Video 2].\n\n4. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for about 30 seconds while focusing on your breathing. Exhale as you tilt back slightly to enhance the stretch [Video 3: T43753AfaKY, Time: 03:28-03:36].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you do not overextend or force your body into the stretch",

By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one.

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching the top of my ear. Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

      "answer": "To perform an upper back corkscrew stretch for self-release and instant pain relief, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Begin by sitting comfortably, ensuring your back is straight. You may also choose to lie down if that feels better for you.\n\n2. **Knee Press**: Press one knee into the ground. This stabilizes your lower body and allows for better rotation of your upper body. \n\n3. **Upper Body Rotation**: Turn your upper body to look away from the knee you are pressing down. For instance, if you press your left knee, rotate your torso to the left. This movement helps to open up the back and may result in a pop or crack, indicating a self-release. It's important to avoid forcing the movement; instead, gently rotate until you feel a comfortable stretch [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 08:14-08:19].\n\n4. **Listen to Your Body**: If you experience any pain beyond a mild stretch, ease off the movement. The goal is to relieve tension, not to cause discomfort [Video 3: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:",

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards the left. From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So for demonstrated purposes, I will be using my can of soup. So if you are using the soup can, just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like this and then roll it up and you kind of have a homemade foam roller. So there I'm just going to position it right on the upper back. So I just go",

And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than the other so you can grab the skin and start to move again but I just can see it's hard to grab. That's why I have the suction cup. So with the suction cups you can go in and around first the area right here where we can do the tarsal tunnel and do some simple movements or even if you like, if you",

Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise.

By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process.

Don't worry too much about the red dots, it's just blood kind of coming to the surface because it is a suction cup, but we're not trying to pull blood or anything like that or do any acupuncture, okay. So these are just simple things you can do with a suction cup. You can get them for like five bucks on Amazon, you get like a whole set. And you'd be surprised you do this pretty frequently throughout the day, like five times or so. And all of a sudden the stuff starts to dissipate and you wonder, why the heck did the suction cup or skin pulling work with this thing, right? It's just a way to desense ties the area. So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well,",

Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than",

      "answer": "To reduce ankle pain using skin rolling, you can employ specific techniques that target the nerves and soft tissues around the ankle. Skin rolling involves gently lifting and rolling the skin over the underlying structures, which can help alleviate local irritation and improve circulation in the area. This technique is particularly beneficial as it addresses the nerves that may contribute to discomfort around the ankle joint [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 00:46-00:52].\n\nIncorporating skin rolling into your routine can enhance mobility and reduce pain by promoting better blood flow and releasing tension in the surrounding tissues. It is essential to perform this technique gently to avoid causing further irritation. \n\nIn summary, skin rolling can be an effective method to manage ankle pain by targeting the nerves and soft tissues. Regular practice may lead to improved comfort and function in the ankle region, making it a valuable addition to your pain management strategies.",

Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection.

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor.

Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt.

So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations.

So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance.

A spacer or holding chamber is an attachment that should always be used with your inhaler. The spacer holds the medicine in place so you can breathe it in easier. Now, let's demonstrate how to correctly use a spacer in mouthpiece. First, remove the cap from the bottom of your inhaler. When you get your new inhaler from the pharmacy, you need to prime or waste it by spraying the medicine into the air four times. Now, fit your inhaler into the opening at the end of the spacer. Shake the inhaler well for 10 seconds. Turn your head to the side and breathe out. Close mouth around mouthpiece of spacer. Push down on the inhaler once. Now the medicine is inside the spacer. Right away, take a slow, deep breath. The goal is not to hear a whistling sound. If you do, this means that you're breathing in too fast. Hold your breath for a count of 10. Now slowly breathe out. Rinse your mouth out with water, or brush teeth, or get a drink after using controller medicines, such as inhaled steroids. Many times, the correct dose of your medicine will be to inhaled two puffs.

And you'd be surprised you do this pretty frequently throughout the day, like five times or so. And all of a sudden the stuff starts to dissipate and you wonder, why the heck did the suction cup or skin pulling work with this thing, right? It's just a way to desense ties the area.

You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique.

And that sounds okay except for the the fact that long term, this causes your lower teeth to get more wear and it's also likely to have wear on the backside of your restoration or chipping or breaking the crown over time because of the way that the bite connects. So hopefully that makes sense but that's one reason, that's this really the second reason why I would avoid crowns is that it changes the bite surface of your natural teeth to a prosthetic and it's really in an area that that's not super beneficial for you. Maybe even a third reason why you might want to avoid having a crown done on a front tooth. You've heard of the reason we would typically do a crown as to make it stronger, help hold a tooth together that's had a lot of decay or old restorations. And we would put the crown on top.

And that sounds okay except for the the fact that long term, this causes your lower teeth to get more wear and it's also likely to have wear on the backside of your restoration or chipping or breaking the crown over time because of the way that the bite connects. So hopefully that makes sense but that's one reason, that's this really the second reason why I would avoid crowns is that it changes the bite surface of your natural teeth to a prosthetic and it's really in an area that that's not super beneficial for you. Maybe even a third reason why you might want to avoid having a crown done on a front tooth. You've heard of the reason we would typically do a crown as to make it stronger, help hold a tooth together that's had a lot of decay or old restorations. And we would put the crown on top. And we put it on top and you have chewing forces like this. It's going, the crown's going to actually be giving that tooth additional strength. The fact that that tooth doesn't have a mammal there anymore is not too damaging, considering the forces this way. Now, if you take a front tooth, so you have a tooth in front where you, your forces really are more of this type of chewing forces where you go like that and you have",

      "answer": "Crowning of the teeth significantly alters the biting surface by necessitating the removal of a portion of the tooth structure, specifically the enamel. During the crown preparation process, a dental burr is used to reduce the tooth by about one millimeter on the top and around the sides, effectively removing the enamel and reshaping the tooth to accommodate the crown [Video 3: LL854--GBy4, Time: 04:05-04:09]. \n\nThis alteration is crucial because it allows for the proper fitting of the crown, which serves to restore the tooth's function and aesthetics. However, this aggressive reduction can impact the tooth's natural biting surface, potentially changing how forces are distributed during chewing. Maintaining the integrity of the tooth structure is essential, as it plays a significant role in the overall function of the dental arch [Video 1: LL854--GBy4, Time: 05:05-05:10]. \n\nIn summary, the crowning process involves significant alteration of the tooth's biting surface through enamel removal, which is necessary for crown placement but can affect the tooth's natural function.",

One of the best ways to strengthen your lower back muscles is to actually train them with your hips. One of my favorite ways to do that at home is with some bridges. Let's go ahead and get started, lay down on your back with both of your knees bent. What I'm going to do now is contract your glutes, squeeze your butt. together and then use that contraction to lift your hips off floor again the emphasis is right here in the butt muscles in those blue muscles we're going to hold this for about three to five seconds and then we're going to come right back now keep in mind the higher you go the more chance that it has to be irritating to your lower back go up as high as you can pay for you try to keep this in as pain free rate as you can I like to tell people we're going to shoot for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then we're going to repeat that through times.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide based on the provided video evidence:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Sit comfortably in a chair with good posture. Ensure you are in a well-lit area to see the pen clearly.\n\n2. **Focus on the Pen**: Hold a pen or similar object in front of you at eye level. \n\n3. **Tracking Movement**: Begin by moving the pen slowly from side to side. As you do this, focus your gaze on the pen. The goal is to keep your eyes trained on the pen as it moves, which helps improve eye coordination and strength.\n\n4. **Cover One Eye**: To further enhance the exercise, cover one eye with your hand while continuing to follow the pen with the uncovered eye. This can help strengthen each eye individually [Video 3: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 02:08-02:15].\n\n5. **Repeat**: Switch eyes and repeat the exercise. \n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you are comfortable and not straining your eyes during the exercise. If you experience any discomfort, stop the exercise and",

I hope these exercises and stretches help you as much as they helped me and my patients. Kind of raises with a ball. Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit.

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first.

Hold a pen at arm's length, with the writing facing you.\n\n2. **Focus Exercise**: Begin by looking at the writing on the pen. Slowly bring the pen closer to your face while maintaining focus on the text. This helps engage the eye muscles and improve focus [Video 3: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 02:08-02:15].\n\n3. **Tracking Movement**: Move the pen side to side and up and down, encouraging your eyes to follow the motion. This will enhance coordination and strengthen the eye muscles. You can count as you move the pen to maintain a rhythm, e.g., \"one, two, three, four, five\" while moving it [Video 3: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 02:08-02:15].\n\n4. **Cover One Eye**: To further challenge your vision, cover one eye while performing the exercise.

As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would take that measurement and then divide it into two. So if you had four inches on the ruler, you would take an actually mark on your swab where two inches would be. So in this case, you would mark right about the junction of the thick portion of the swab narrowing down. In the case of the adult on this particular swab that works out perfectly almost every time for this junction to be the correct of insertion with the child or an infant you're going to go a little less deep so measuring is often very good especially in the younger kids so that you don't insert the swab too far. I'm now going to demonstrate inserting the swab correctly on myself and I'm going to show",

Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this.

And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists of nerves and blood vessels and it runs essentially from your neck into your shoulder and it can be compressed here, it can be compressed by a muscle or can be compressed by the clavicle or it can be compressed by the first rape even.

So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting better control. Sometimes with this less flexible shaft, especially in lower kids that you're only inserting in a small distance. There is not as much control and you tend to have a little more flex in the swab shaft causing it not to pick up cells quite as well. So I typically prefer this shaft over the lower one bed both work equally well",

I'm now going to demonstrate inserting the swab correctly on myself and I'm going to show you how to do it where it causes a patient minimal discomfort and can easily be done in a type of setting. With the swab you're going to take it and very gently guide it into the air and you're going to feel it go just up and over at about this area you'll feel it just go over that little skin ledge at the bottom of the nose. At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates.

At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates. You can see that this is not a noxious thing. It's not causing me any discomfort. I'm still sitting here fairly carefully talking to you and not crying kicking your screaming. You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this",

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B",

This protects you from potential illness transmission [Video 1: kSpggqOLgaU, Time: 05:00-05:06].\n\n2. **Insertion Technique**: Begin by gently inserting the swab into the patient's nostril. Aim for the bottom of the nose, and then transition to a horizontal position as you continue to insert the swab. This technique helps ensure you reach the correct anatomical area [Video 1: kSpggqOLgaU, Time: 06:47-06:53].\n\n3. **Depth Confirmation**: Continue to insert the swab until you feel resistance, indicating that you have reached the correct depth, which is typically under the inferior turbinates. It\u2019s important to note that this should not cause significant discomfort to the patient [Video 1: kSpggqOLgaU, Time: 06:47-06:53].\n\n4. **Sample Collection**:",

So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting better control. Sometimes with this less flexible shaft, especially in lower kids that you're only inserting in a small distance. There is not as much control and you tend to have a little more flex in the swab shaft causing it not to pick up cells quite as well. So I typically prefer this shaft over the lower one bed both work equally well",

You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this while off and you'll see how easily it snaps off and goes into your tube.",

So the first structure that actually cause you a shoulder pin is your neck. shoulder pin can arise from your neck, especially if you're suffering from a ridiculously, which is essentially a nerve which is being pinched in the neck. And you know when you have a ridiculously, because you have this shooting pin from your, from your neck into your shoulder, into your elbow, into your arms, some of the even to your fingers. And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into.

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

One is kind of a neck strain that you get from maybe lifting something too heavy or doing an exercise where you really kind of strain into your neck. And the second way is when you have your head in a position and it can be either way where the pain in the neck can come from this part of the side of the neck where the muscles have been compressed in or too short or it can be from this side where the muscles are stretched in too long. It's usually this side, I find, in most of my patients. So you will also feel a lot of times with neck pain. You also feel it kind of going down into the shoulder blade.

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck. So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep",

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck.

One is kind of a neck strain that you get from maybe lifting something too heavy or doing an exercise where you really kind of strain into your neck.

      "answer": "To avoid a crick in your neck, performing chin tucks can help strengthen the neck muscles effectively. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Start by grabbing a rolled towel. This will be placed behind the arch of your neck for support while you perform the exercise. Lay flat on your back on a comfortable surface, bending your knees if necessary to protect your lower back [Video 3: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 00:48-00:52].\n\n2. **Chin Tuck Execution**: While lying down, gently tuck your chin towards your chest. This movement should be subtle; you want to create a double chin effect without lifting your head off the ground. Hold this position for a few seconds, focusing on engaging the muscles at the back of your neck [Video 3].\n\n3. **Repetitions**: Repeat this exercise for several sets, ensuring you maintain a relaxed posture throughout. It\u2019s important to perform this exercise consistently to strengthen the front neck muscles, which can help improve overall posture and reduce neck strain [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 08:06-08:08].\n\n**Safety Note**:",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

This position allows the drops to flow directly into the ear canal [Video 1: v0HODFTrkqs, Time: 00:18-00:24].\n\n2. **Preparation**: Gently pull the outer ear (pinna) backward and upward to straighten the ear canal. This will help you see down the ear canal more clearly and ensure proper placement of the drops [Video 1].\n\n3. **Application**: Administer one drop of the medication into the ear canal. It is important to apply the drops carefully to avoid any discomfort [Video 1].\n\n4. **Facilitating Flow**: After applying the first drop, press gently on the front of the ear. This action helps the drop to run down toward the eardrum, enhancing its effectiveness [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repeat**: Continue applying additional drops as prescribed, ensuring that each drop is placed correctly and allowed to flow into the ear [Video 1].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always ensure the ear drops are at room temperature before use to avoid discomfort",

          "text": "The main diagnostic test for CPD is called Spirometry. Spirometry is a lung-faction test that assesses how much air goes in and out of your lungs and how fast it does so. You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists of nerves and blood vessels and it runs essentially from your neck into your shoulder and it can be compressed here, it can be compressed by a muscle or can be compressed by the clavicle or it can be compressed by the first rape even. And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test.

Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a",

And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is",

If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on top of your shoulder. So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint.

This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot.

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video. Weighted, dorsy flexion Start by sitting on a small stall with a weightlifting plate rested on your knees Drive your knees forward as possible and pass your toes without your heels coming off the ground. Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch",

I hope these exercises and stretches help you as much as they helped me and my patients. Kind of raises with a ball. Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets.

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

And again, hold that for about 30 seconds. So that's exercise number one. Y-W-T-L, really good exercise to get rid of that. That was just hump in the back of your neck. The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before",

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

      "answer": "To perform an ATY mobilization exercise to reduce a neck hump, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Posture Alignment**: Start by ensuring you are in a comfortable standing position with your feet shoulder-width apart. Focus on maintaining an upright posture throughout the exercise.\n\n2. **Arm Positioning**: Place your hands behind your back and grasp your wrists. This position helps engage your shoulder muscles effectively.\n\n3. **Squeeze Shoulder Blades**: Pull your arms straight, keeping your elbows locked. As you do this, squeeze your shoulder blades together. This action helps open up the chest and counteracts the forward head posture associated with a neck hump [Video 3: T43753AfaKY, Time: 03:06-03:12].\n\n4. **Neck Tilt**: While holding this position, gently tilt your head back. As you tilt, remember to breathe out slowly. This helps to stretch the neck muscles and further alleviate tension [Video 2: T43753AfaKY, Time: 03:28-03:36].\n\n5. **Duration**: Hold this position for about 30 seconds, ensuring you maintain a steady breath throughout [Video 2].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always",

And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back.

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump. Often people who experience a neck hump or a buffalo hump also experience a bit of neck pain as well. I've done some",

So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down.

Now it's quite an intense exercise. If you're struggling to hold each position for 10 seconds, repeat five times, what you do is do the A first for 10 seconds, then you move to the T, then you move to the Y, you hold each about 10 seconds and you give yourself a rest.

If you're struggling to hold each position for 10 seconds, repeat five times, what you do is do the A first for 10 seconds, then you move to the T, then you move to the Y, you hold each about 10 seconds and you give yourself a rest. I do 80 y again. A brilliant exercise to reduce the neck hump. Just a quick one. If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book.

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

Ensure that your arm is straight and at shoulder height.\n\n2. **Slide Your Hand**: Begin by sliding your right hand up the wall while keeping your shoulder down and relaxed. This movement helps to stretch the muscles in your upper back and shoulders, which can alleviate tension contributing to the neck hump [Video 3: T43753AfaKY, Time: 03:28-03:36].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Once your hand is as high as it can comfortably go, hold this position for about 30 seconds. During this time, focus on your breathing; exhale gently as you maintain the stretch [Video 3].\n\n4. **Posture Awareness**: Throughout the exercise, be mindful of your posture. Ensure you are standing upright and not slouching, as good posture is crucial in reducing strain on the neck [Video 2].\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience any pain or discomfort during the exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. It's important to perform",

I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump.

So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down.

Now it's quite an intense exercise. If you're struggling to hold each position for 10 seconds, repeat five times, what you do is do the A first for 10 seconds, then you move to the T, then you move to the Y, you hold each about 10 seconds and you give yourself a rest. I do 80 y again. A brilliant exercise to reduce the neck hump. Just a quick one. If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below.

And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out.

Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

All you need to do, super simple, all you need to do is support the arm that holds your phone with the other hand to look. What I'm doing now is I'm supporting my elbow of the hand that holds my phone upright, suddenly my phone is upright, suddenly I'm not dropping my head forwards and not creating a lot of pressure on this area where I have my neck hump, phones upright, I can look at the phone this way, I'll create less pressure on the neck, and all the exercise that you do during the day, suddenly bare fruit, because you're taking away irritation throughout the day. So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure",

      "answer": "To reduce neck pressure while using your cell phone, it is essential to maintain proper posture. Keeping your head aligned with your spine and avoiding forward head posture can significantly alleviate strain. While the provided videos do not explicitly detail how to hold your phone, they emphasize the importance of posture and exercises to mitigate neck issues.\n\nFor instance, the first video mentions that gadgets like cell phones can contribute to neck problems, including the development of a \"neck hump\" due to poor positioning [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 06:23-06:30]. Additionally, maintaining a neutral spine while using your phone is crucial. This means holding the device at eye level to avoid tilting your head down, which can exacerbate neck strain.\n\nIn summary, to minimize neck pressure while using your cell phone, ensure that you hold it at eye level and maintain a neutral posture. Regularly practicing posture correction exercises can also help support neck health over time. The provided video evidence does not contain specific techniques for phone usage but highlights the importance of posture in preventing neck issues.",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward.

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe,",

You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already",

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump. Often people who experience a neck hump or a buffalo hump also experience a bit of neck pain as well. I've done some",

Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or as a review, when you breathe in, your abdomen is actually expanding. And that opens up the diaphragm. So when Brad breathes in, you can see how it is expanding when he breathes out, it actually goes down. That's the opposite of what people quite often think. A lot of times they think, but breathing my chest should go out, but it's actually you want your diaphragm to go out. So if I have quick breaths, and then we can go on and start the exercises. So the first one, just to kind of get a little movement for the abdomen here, where actually just going to do kind of flexing forward here for five times. I'm sorry, these are all 10 to 15 times actually. Let's stick with 15. OK, 15 times. So you just kind of come forward a little bit here. Very easy to do. 15 times. We'll say we're up to 15, all right? Sure. So we're going to put it all along. Number two, you're actually going to rotate the trunk using your hips. So Brad's going to go ahead and do that.

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight now the whole thrust expires from the top to the bottom. And it's very very simple.

Keep your elbows straight, pull your arms backwards, and hold this for about 30 seconds if you can. And then from the",

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise.

You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10 rotation before moving to the next spot.

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here.

You can reach back with one thumb into the area of the shoulder blade to find the tender spots [Video 2: 01:11-01:13].\n\n2. **Apply Pressure**: Once you find a tender spot, press gently into it with your thumb. This area may be quite painful, so ensure you are applying a manageable amount of pressure [Video 1: 01:20-01:23].\n\n3. **Hold the Pressure**: Maintain this pressure on the tender spot for about 20-30 seconds. This allows the muscle to release tension [Video 1: 01:20-01:23].\n\n4. **Repeat**: After holding, return to the same spot and repeat the process 6-8 times to ensure effective release of the muscle tension [Video 1: 01:20-01:23].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Be cautious not to apply too much pressure, as this can lead to increased pain or discomfort.

Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10 rotation before moving to the next spot.

The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators.

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique.

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the",

Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10 rotation before moving to the next spot.

The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here.

Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10 rotation before moving to the next spot.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is.

Then check to see if there's anything in their mouth. If there is, tell them to pick it out. If back blows don't work, try giving up to five abdominal thrusts. Squeeze it out. To give With your domino thrust, stand behind them, put your arms around them and link your hands between their tummy button and the bottom of their chest. Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives. If they become unresponsive, open the airway and check their breathing. If they're not breathing normally, start CPR. So remember, if someone's choking, cough it out, slap it out, squeeze it out.

To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

So, but you can clearly see we started with these and we worked the muscles here and we just went down the way. And to be honest, Brad, what you should do is you want to go that way. And the next time, even if you want to do a full thing, you go down and then come back again. Okay. Or the next time start with the toes and then go up. Okay. So just to mix it up a little bit and get the fluid moving. So good luck with your adema. Let's hopefully we can get that resolved. And remember Brad and I can fix this one in the next step for a broken heart. Put it right over Brad. Yeah, boom, boom, boom, boom. All right. Thanks for watching.",

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor.

      "answer": "To treat a minor burn, first ensure it is indeed a minor burn, as only these should be treated at home. For a first-degree minor burn, immerse the affected area in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses for about 10 minutes. This helps to alleviate pain and cool the burn, preventing further skin damage. It is crucial to avoid using ice directly on the burn, as it can cause additional skin injury. After cooling the burn, gently pat the area dry and cover it with a sterile, non-stick bandage to protect it from infection. Over-the-counter pain relief medications may also be utilized to manage discomfort. If the burn shows signs of infection or if symptoms worsen, seek medical attention promptly. Remember, if the burn is severe or covers a large area, call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately [Video 1: ZNWjfe-84Ig, Time: 01:04-01:06]. In summary, cooling the burn and protecting it are key steps in treating minor burns effectively.",

In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early",

She's going to tell the patient she's going to feel a little pinch. And the one good thing about a butterfly, it's a smaller needle, so it hurts less. And the other thing is, whenever you have stuck the needle inside the vein, you're going to see a flash of blood. So that lets you know you hit a vein. And the way the blood comes down is once you take one of the tubes, the insert tube in to the plastic hub that she's holding in her hand.

If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from. Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball",

By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10",

We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier.

You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder the other side shoulder When you do this you'll really feel it open up into the neck right here and a lot of times You'll get a sudden pop crack or release into the neck or into the upper back It usually feels really good again with this one don't try to force it You want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds you're just going to relax and then on the next repetition drive the arm over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the shoulder even more get a better stretch each time and I would do this on both sides to keep them in balance.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it.

Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

It's very important to use your inhaler the correct way to make sure the medicine gets deposited into the lungs where it works the best. In correct technique can leave some of the particles from the medicine on your tongue or throat, where it won't help at all. A spacer or holding chamber is an attachment that should always be used with your inhaler. The spacer holds the medicine in place so you can breathe it in easier. Now, let's demonstrate how to correctly use a spacer in mouthpiece. First, remove the cap from the bottom of your inhaler. When you get your new inhaler from the pharmacy, you need to prime or waste it by spraying the medicine into the air four times. Now, fit your inhaler into the opening at the end of the spacer. Shake the inhaler well for 10 seconds. Turn your head to the side and breathe out. Close mouth around mouthpiece of spacer. Push down on the inhaler once. Now the medicine is inside the spacer. Right away, take a slow, deep breath. The goal is not to hear a whistling sound. If you do, this means that you're breathing in too fast. Hold your breath for a count of 10. Now slowly breathe",

When you get your new inhaler from the pharmacy, you need to prime or waste it by spraying the medicine into the air four times. Now, fit your inhaler into the opening at the end of the spacer. Shake the inhaler well for 10 seconds. Turn your head to the side and breathe out. Close mouth around mouthpiece of spacer. Push down on the inhaler once. Now the medicine is inside the spacer. Right away, take a slow, deep breath. The goal is not to hear a whistling sound. If you do, this means that you're breathing in too fast. Hold your breath for a count of 10. Now slowly breathe out. Rinse your mouth out with water, or brush teeth, or get a drink after using controller medicines, such as inhaled steroids. Many times, the correct dose of your medicine will be to inhaled two puffs. If this is what is prescribed for you, then wait one minute after the first puff, and then follow all of the steps again. Remember, if you have questions, call your doctor's office as a care team or pharmacy. You",

Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well.

And this mouthpiece is like a snorkeling mouthpiece, so I need your lips over the outside portion of it and your teeth go behind it, teeth bind it on the two tabs. And just want to be sure, tongue is not including the hole in the mouthpiece. And just want you to begin with some normal breathing. All right, and I'll take a nasty breath in and blast it out. Keep blowing, keep blowing, keep going, you're doing great. Keep going, keep pushing out, keep pushing, and ghee, boi, shing. Take a fast, you breath on the way back in. It's great, you can come off that mouthpiece, and you can take those noseclubs off. As you can see, spirometry is an easy test to take. Talk to your provider about spirometry.",

Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives.

So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would take that measurement and then divide it into two. So if you had four inches on the ruler, you would take an actually mark on your swab where two inches would be. So in this case, you would mark right about the junction of the thick portion of the swab narrowing down. In the case of the adult on this particular swab that works out perfectly almost every time for this junction to be the correct of insertion with the child or an infant you're going to go a little less deep so measuring is often very good especially in the younger kids so that you don't insert the swab too far.

You can see on this diagram behind me and I'll use my swab as a pointer that you're actually going horizontally. You're not going vertically. You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area. If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all. And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key. So I'm going to go through a couple steps and show you exactly how this is done. I also want to tell you that this far is protected where and gear. Some people will deck out in everything including a gown, gloves, mask. I sheelts, typically in my setting the respiratory therapist, text, doctor's nurses. We all just put all the pair of gloves.

At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates. You can see that this is not a noxious thing. It's not causing me any discomfort. I'm still sitting here fairly carefully talking to you and not crying kicking your screaming. You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on",

Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it, but that's where your problem comes from AC joint. It could also also be a bit of osteoarthritis, you need to be really a bit older for that, maybe having had a drum and a past in your shoulder, a lot of grinding goes on, I'm not talking about the occasional clicking when you move your arm, but it's the grinding stuff, that is a bit of a telltale sign as well as osteoarthritis, and you can have an appingement, an appingement is actually one of the tendons within the shoulder joint in the area, which get impeached.

So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on",

For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your",

Now the test you can do for that on the right side is literally put your right hand on your left shoulder and then raise your arm up. This is so then you've most likely got an impingement in the shoulder itself or you can do the drop arm test where the arm is, you lift the arm up using the other hand or the way up and you bring it down and the drop arm test means you get to a stage where it gets really sore and you actually can't keep it up, you can't keep the arm up itself, we need to go, oh like that, you have this painful arc, that's a positive sign as well for an arrangement. So first thing we need to know, what's actually causing your shoulder problems, then we can help it, there's a few things we can do for you to help, there's a few bits, can do as well to help.

So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

So the first structure that actually cause you a shoulder pin is your neck. shoulder pin can arise from your neck, especially if you're suffering from a ridiculously, which is essentially a nerve which is being pinched in the neck. And you know when you have a ridiculously, because you have this shooting pin from your, from your neck into your shoulder, into your elbow, into your arms, some of the even to your fingers. And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

      "answer": "To self-diagnose shoulder pain potentially related to a rotator cuff injury, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Subscapularis Muscle**: This muscle is attached to your shoulder blade. To find it, raise your arm and reach with your opposite thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. You should feel a slight tenderness in this area, which can indicate issues with the muscle [Video 1: 0CD3mYjPXxk, Time: 01:11-01:13].\n\n2. **Identify Trigger Points**: Once you locate the tender spot, gently press into it. If you find a particularly painful area, this is likely a trigger point. Hold the pressure on this spot for 20-30 seconds to help release the tension [Video 2: 0CD3mYjPXxk, Time: 01:20-01:23].\n\n3. **Repeat the Process**: Return to the tender spot 6-8 times to ensure the muscle releases properly. This technique is known as myofascial release and can help alleviate pain [Video 2].\n\n**Safety Note**: If the pain worsens or does not improve with these techniques, consult",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade.

So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out.

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand.

By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

So the first structure that actually cause you a shoulder pin is your neck. shoulder pin can arise from your neck, especially if you're suffering from a ridiculously, which is essentially a nerve which is being pinched in the neck. And you know when you have a ridiculously, because you have this shooting pin from your, from your neck into your shoulder, into your elbow, into your arms, some of the even to your fingers. And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists",

If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Place your hand on your left shoulder and then raise your arm up. If you experience pain during this movement, it may indicate shoulder impingement [Video 3: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time: 06:17-06:20].\n\nAnother useful test is the drop arm test. For this, lift your arm up using your other hand and then slowly lower it. If you find that you reach a point where it becomes very painful or you cannot control the descent, this could suggest an impingement [Video 3: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time: 06:17-06:20].\n\nWhile performing these tests, be cautious and stop if the pain is severe. It\u2019s important to note that self-diagnosis should not replace professional medical evaluation. If you suspect shoulder impingement, consider consulting a healthcare professional for a thorough assessment and appropriate treatment options.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video. Weighted, dorsy flexion Start by sitting on a small stall with a weightlifting plate rested on your knees Drive your knees forward as possible and pass your toes without your heels coming off the ground. Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like",

Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks",

This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower back there's not really much movement occurring it's a very safe position for your spine can be in but we're working all of the muscles but we want to stabilize your back as we're doing these swimmers looks just like this we're we're going to repeat this once again about 10 to 20 repetitions on each side and then we're going to repeat that",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit on a bench or chair that allows your knees to bend at approximately 90 degrees. This position is crucial for effective exercise execution [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 01:28-01:38].\n\n2. **Tennis Ball Exercise**: Place a tennis ball between your heels and pinch it gently. This action creates slight foot e-version, which helps engage the muscles in your legs and feet, promoting better blood flow and reducing swelling [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 01:28-01:38].\n\n3. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10 to 20 repetitions of this exercise. It\u2019s recommended to repeat this set three times to maximize the benefits [Video 3: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 02:21-02:26].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure that you perform these exercises at a pain-free rate. If you experience discomfort, adjust your position or reduce the intensity of the exercise",

And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a",

The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from.

Or if you just take some pillows and put them on and you can get your feet up higher than your heart if you're possible. But that's doing a pretty good job. But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad. Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or as a review, when you breathe in, your abdomen is actually expanding. And that opens up the diaphragm. So when Brad breathes in, you can see how it is expanding when he breathes out, it actually goes down. That's the opposite of what people quite often think.

So we want to get it, the thing is, if you want to get rid of fluid, it's not going to go out your toes. It's got to go back up into your trunk where it gets processed and then it gets expelled from the body. In other words, your urinate or pee it out. Right, to be graphing. So we got to get the fluid back up into this area. So that's why it works really well if you can take like a leg wedge, we often recommend this for a back pain too. Or if you just take some pillows and put them on and you can get your feet up higher than your heart if you're possible. But that's doing a pretty good job. But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad.

I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral",

I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full side plank. Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower",

And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement.

This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower back there's not really much movement occurring it's a very safe position for your spine can be in but we're working all of the muscles but we want to stabilize your back as we're doing these swimmers looks just like this we're we're going to repeat this once again about 10 to 20 repetitions on each side and then we're going to repeat that",

So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were?

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full side plank. Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds.

If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full side plank. Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic.

Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks",

That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to strengthen your lower back muscles is to actually train them with your hips. One of my favorite ways to do that at home is with some bridges. Let's go ahead and get started, lay down on your back with both of your knees bent. What I'm going to do now is contract your glutes, squeeze your butt. together and then use that contraction to",

And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower back there's not really much movement occurring it's a very safe position for your spine can be in but we're working all of the muscles but we want to stabilize your back as we're doing these swimmers looks just like this we're we're going to repeat this once again about 10 to 20 repetitions on each side and then we're going to repeat that",

But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad. Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or as a review, when you breathe in, your abdomen is actually expanding. And that opens up the diaphragm. So when Brad breathes in, you can see how it is expanding when he breathes out, it actually goes down. That's the opposite of what people quite often think. A lot of times they think, but breathing my chest should go out, but it's actually you want your diaphragm to go out. So if I have quick breaths, and then we can go on and start the exercises. So the first one, just to kind of get a little movement for the abdomen here, where actually just going to do kind of flexing forward here for five times.

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

Let's go ahead and get started, lay down on your back with both of your knees bent. What I'm going to do now is contract your glutes, squeeze your butt. together and then use that contraction to lift your hips off floor again the emphasis is right here in the butt muscles in those blue muscles we're going to hold this for about three to five seconds and then we're going to come right back now keep in mind the higher you go the more chance that it has to be irritating to your lower back go up as high as you can pay for you try to keep this in as pain free rate as you can I like to tell people we're going to shoot for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then we're going to repeat that through times.

Okay, next one, marching in place. So Brad, he's just doing hip flexion, you know, you know, laterally, you know, going back and forth. You got it, number, oh yeah, never going to kick outs, there you go, yeah, excellent. Grad, you're a good student. Well, I've been practicing Bob.

          "text": "of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching. I really want you to join my VIP Facebook group. I want to build a community where we can discuss all things health and be on",

Or if you just take some pillows and put them on and you can get your feet up higher than your heart if you're possible. But that's doing a pretty good job. But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad. Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or as a review, when you breathe in, your abdomen is actually expanding. And that opens up the diaphragm. So when Brad breathes in, you can see how it is expanding when he breathes out, it actually goes down. That's the opposite of what people quite often think. A lot of times they think, but breathing my chest should go out, but it's actually you want your diaphragm to go out. So if I have quick breaths, and then we can go on and start the exercises. So the first one, just to kind of get a little movement for the abdomen here, where actually just going to do kind of flexing forward here for five times. I'm sorry, these are all 10 to 15 times actually. Let's stick",

This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower back there's not really much movement occurring it's a very safe position for your spine can be in but we're working all of the muscles but we want to stabilize your back as we're doing these swimmers looks just like this we're we're going to repeat this once again about 10 to 20 repetitions on each side and then we're going to repeat that",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe,",

What is sciatic and well-explained or numbness or can you leave them run down the back your leg? Most of the time caused by some problem of your your core back. If we can teach you the right strengthening and stabilization exercises to help minimize some of that problem, you're going to feel a lot better. That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

And then the other side, what I'm going to do is bend the knee and then keep the foot flat.

So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If",

So we want to get it, the thing is, if you want to get rid of fluid, it's not going to go out your toes. It's got to go back up into your trunk where it gets processed and then it gets expelled from the body. In other words, your urinate or pee it out. Right, to be graphing. So we got to get the fluid back up into this area. So that's why it works really well if you can take like a leg wedge, we often recommend this for a back pain too. Or if you just take some pillows and put them on and you can get your feet up higher than your heart if you're possible. But that's doing a pretty good job. But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad. Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or",

This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice.

And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower back there's not really much movement occurring it's a very safe position for your spine can be in but we're working all of the muscles but we want to stabilize your back as we're doing these swimmers looks just like this we're we're going to repeat this once again about 10 to 20 repetitions on each side and then we're going to repeat that",

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs.

So we want to get it, the thing is, if you want to get rid of fluid, it's not going to go out your toes. It's got to go back up into your trunk where it gets processed and then it gets expelled from the body. In other words, your urinate or pee it out. Right, to be graphing. So we got to get the fluid back up into this area. So that's why it works really well if you can take like a leg wedge, we often recommend this for a back pain too. Or if you just take some pillows and put them on and you can get your feet up higher than your heart if you're possible. But that's doing a pretty good job. But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad.

Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks",

So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out.

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that",

Doctor of physical therapy, tone and time, and in this video I want to share with you five of the best core strengthening exercises for your sciatic nerve pain. What is sciatic and well-explained or numbness or can you leave them run down the back your leg? Most of the time caused by some problem of your your core back. If we can teach you the right strengthening and stabilization exercises to help minimize some of that problem, you're going to feel a lot better. That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight.

And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a",

And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower back there's not really much movement occurring it's a very safe position for your spine can be in but we're working all of the muscles but we want to stabilize your back as we're doing these swimmers looks just like this we're we're going to repeat this once again about 10 to 20 repetitions on each side and then we're going to repeat that",

One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full",

You're going to be down here understanding once the end arm is extended over your head. Now what we're going to do is lift our arms and chest up off of the floor. Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees come up off of the floor. And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day.

Bend both knees so your feet are flat on the ground, hip-width apart [Video 1: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 01:44-01:50].\n\n2. **Engage Your Muscles**: Contract your glutes by squeezing your buttocks together. This contraction is crucial for effectively lifting your hips [Video 1: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 01:44-01:50].\n\n3. **Lift Your Hips**: Using the contraction of your glutes, lift your hips off the ground. Aim to create a straight line from your shoulders to your knees at the top of the movement [Video 1: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 01:44-01:50].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Perform 10 to 20 repetitions of this exercise. It\u2019s recommended to repeat the set three times for optimal benefit [Video 2: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 02:21-02:26].\n\n",

You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower back there's not really much movement occurring it's a very safe position for your spine can be in but we're working all of the muscles but we want to stabilize your back as we're doing these swimmers looks just like this we're we're going to repeat this once again about 10 to 20 repetitions on each side and then we're going to repeat that",

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips.

Usually what I'll tell people is we'll use the swimmers as a way to get to the next exercise. A lot of times this is a little more aggressive but it's my personal favorite way to straighten the entire spine. Last exercise that I want to demonstrate for you today is a superman exercise. You're going to be down here understanding once the end arm is extended over your head. Now what we're going to do is lift our arms and chest up off of the floor.

And then from there I'm going to wing my elbows down as much as I can. and then just raise my arms overhead just like this. You'll feel, again, the muscles just get hit a little bit differently, and that might just help. If you feel like it still needs a little bit more attention, you can put a little bit more of a passive stretch in there. So what I'm going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all the way down towards the floor. I'm going to straighten my arms out like this, straight at the elbow, hands are going to overlap, and then I'm going to lower my hands down towards the floor as much as I can. The more that you lower the down, the more that you're going to feel, that spot over the can and the upper back really start to open, only go to your comfort level.

About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a link right here.

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you.

One of the best ways to strengthen your lower back muscles is to actually train them with your hips. One of my favorite ways to do that at home is with some bridges. Let's go ahead and get started, lay down on your back with both of your knees bent. What I'm going to do now is contract your glutes, squeeze your butt. together and then use that contraction to lift your hips off floor again the emphasis is right here in the butt muscles in those blue muscles we're going to hold this for about three to five seconds and then we're going to come right back now keep in mind the higher you go the more chance that it has to be irritating to your lower back go up as high as you can pay for you try to keep this in as pain free rate as you can I like to tell people we're going to shoot for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then we're going to repeat that through times. Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're",

You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot.

This position helps maintain a neutral spine.\n\n2. **Engage Core**: Before moving, engage your core by drawing your belly button towards your spine. This action stabilizes your lower back during the exercise [Video 3: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 02:21-02:26].\n\n3. **Extend Limbs**: Slowly extend your right arm forward while simultaneously extending your left leg backward. Keep both limbs straight and in line with your body. Hold this position for a moment to maintain balance.\n\n4. **Return to Start**: Gently return to the starting position and switch sides, extending your left arm and right leg.\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10 to 20 repetitions on each side, repeating the cycle for three sets [Video 3: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 02:21-02:26].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that your movements are slow and controlled to avoid straining your back.",

We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If",

I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full side plank. Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that",

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of",

I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full side plank. Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower",

      "answer": "To perform a side plank exercise targeting the lateral hip muscles, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Begin by lying on your side with your legs extended and stacked on top of each other. Your elbow should be directly under your shoulder for support.\n\n2. **Lift Your Hips**: Engage your core and lift your hips off the ground, creating a straight line from your head to your feet. Ensure that your hip remains parallel to the floor throughout the exercise to maintain stability and prevent rolling [Video 1: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 03:11-03:16].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for a set duration, focusing on keeping your hips aligned. Aim for 10 to 20 repetitions per side, ensuring you repeat the exercise three times for effectiveness [Video 1: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 03:33-03:35].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Be cautious not to let your hips drop or roll forward, as this can lead to instability in your back. Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise to support your lower back and enhance lateral stability [Video 1: CWRWeoaq",

We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If",

The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side.

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down",

      "answer": "To perform a side plank exercise that effectively engages the lateral hip muscles, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Begin by lying on your side with your legs stacked. You can support your body weight on your forearm, ensuring your elbow is directly under your shoulder. \n\n2. **Body Alignment**: As you lift your hips off the ground, keep your body in a straight line from head to heels. It's crucial to maintain this alignment and prevent your hips from rolling forward or backward. Your hips should remain parallel to the floor throughout the exercise [Video 1: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 03:11-03:16].\n\n3. **Engagement**: Focus on engaging your core and lateral hip muscles. Avoid letting your hip open towards the ground, as this can compromise stability and effectiveness [Video 1: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 03:11-03:16].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10 to 20 repetitions on each side, and repeat the exercise three times for optimal results [Video 3: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 03:33-03:35].\n\n**",

And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So",

There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg.

This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower back there's not really much movement occurring it's a very safe position for your spine can be in but we're working all of the muscles but we want to stabilize your back as we're doing these swimmers looks just like this we're we're going to repeat this once again about 10 to 20 repetitions on each side and then we're going to repeat that",

The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight.

A lot of times this is a little more aggressive but it's my personal favorite way to straighten the entire spine. Last exercise that I want to demonstrate for you today is a superman exercise. You're going to be down here understanding once the end arm is extended over your head. Now what we're going to do is lift our arms and chest up off of the floor. Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees come up off of the floor. And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that,",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day.

I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full side plank. Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower",

From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards the left. From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

This exercise engages the abdominal muscles and strengthens the lower back, which is crucial for spinal support. \n\nTo do the Superman exercise, first, lay down on a mat or flat surface with your arms outstretched in front of you. Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Then, simultaneously raise your arms and legs about five inches off the ground. Hold this position for five seconds, ensuring that your core is engaged and your back is straight. After holding, return to the starting position and repeat the exercise as needed [Video 3: Y9-54bnvPGg, Time: 00:19-00:21].\n\nIn summary, the Superman exercise is an effective way to strengthen the muscles that support the spine, promoting better posture and reducing the risk of back pain. Regular practice can enhance core stability and overall spinal health.",

About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a link right here.

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs.

The exercise involves lying face down and lifting your arms and legs off the ground simultaneously, engaging your core and back muscles. It is suggested to perform about three sets of ten repetitions once a day, which helps strengthen the lower back and improve stability without overexerting yourself [Video 1: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 06:37-06:42].\n\nSupporting this approach, the exercise should be done with attention to your body's response, particularly if you experience any discomfort. It is essential to ensure that you are not straining your back or legs excessively, as this could aggravate sciatic pain. \n\nIn summary, the Superman exercise can be beneficial for strengthening the back while minimizing sciatic nerve pain if done in moderation, with a recommended frequency of once daily and a focus on proper form. Always listen to your body and consult with a healthcare professional if pain persists.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

I hope these exercises and stretches help you as much as they helped me and my patients. Kind of raises with a ball. Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards.

Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do.

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video. Weighted, dorsy flexion Start by sitting on a small stall with a weightlifting plate rested on your knees Drive your knees forward as possible and pass your toes without your heels coming off the ground. Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch",

The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from.

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor.

By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight.

The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from.

Ensure you are comfortable and stable in your position [Video 2: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 03:09-03:17].\n\n2. **Starting Position**: With the weight on your knees, drive your knees forward as much as possible. This movement is crucial for engaging the muscles in your feet and calves [Video 2].\n\n3. **Foot Positioning**: Roll your ankles outward and your heels inward. This positioning helps in activating the intrinsic muscles of the foot [Video 3: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 02:02-02:08].\n\n4. **Execution**: Push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift your heels up. Squeeze your calf muscles as if performing a calf raise, and visualize creating an arch under your foot. This action is essential for strengthening the foot's arch [Video 3].\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions, completing 3 to 4",

A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video. Weighted, dorsy flexion Start by sitting on a small stall with a weightlifting plate rested on your knees Drive your knees forward as possible and pass your toes without your heels coming off the ground. Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch",

Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process.

Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10 rotation before moving to the next spot.

The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from.

This setup allows you to apply resistance while performing the exercise [Video 2: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 03:09-03:17].\n\n2. **Movement**: Drive your knees forward as much as possible while keeping your feet flat on the ground. This action engages the muscles in your lower legs and feet [Video 2].\n\n3. **Foot Positioning**: As you perform the exercise, roll your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. This positioning helps activate the intrinsic muscles of the foot [Video 3: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 02:02-02:08].\n\n4. **Calf Engagement**: Push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift your heels, similar to a calf raise. Visualize creating an arch under your foot as you do this [Video 3].\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions for 3 to 4 sets. This frequency can help strengthen the foot muscles",

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do.

Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs.

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that",

Place the sole of your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over it. Focus on spending more time on any tender areas you encounter during the rolling process. This technique helps to alleviate tension and improve mobility in the foot, which can contribute to better overall movement and injury prevention, particularly for conditions related to the lower back and foot [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 05:57-06:02].\n\nIn summary, using a lacrosse or massage ball for self-release involves sitting, placing the ball on the ground, and rolling your foot over it, paying special attention to sensitive spots. This exercise can enhance foot function and reduce discomfort, making it a beneficial addition to your routine.",

So the first thing you're going to do is put on a turning kit, So we have to look for a vein, and the turning kit is going to go, this is going to increase to the elbow, it's going to go about three to four inches above it, and once you put time to turn it, show our exhibition if it's too tight, and then that's the patient to pop their fist a couple times, and she's going to pop it, we'll pop it in is where she's going to just feel for a vein, and the vein will bounce back on her fingers that sure know that's a good thing. So you never go by site, you always go by touch to feel for a vein. And he has a pretty good vein right in the middle and this is the vein that we this is the first vein that we use in full army. And then just choice two and three. Once he has popated, she's going to clean the area and there is a proper way of cleaning the area which you're going to do is you're going to start from",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

A lot of times this is a little more aggressive but it's my personal favorite way to straighten the entire spine. Last exercise that I want to demonstrate for you today is a superman exercise. You're going to be down here understanding once the end arm is extended over your head. Now what we're going to do is lift our arms and chest up off of the floor. Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees come up off of the floor. And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day.

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a",

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump. Often people who experience a neck hump or a buffalo hump also experience a bit of neck pain as well. I've done some",

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of",

So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight now the whole thrust expires from the top to the bottom. And it's very very simple. So what you do? You raise your arms in the air, hand palms facing forward, arms in the air, and you really pull your arms backwards.

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

      "answer": "To improve posture and reduce the neck hump, you can perform specific YWTL exercises. One effective exercise involves standing against a wall and sliding your arm up while tilting your head back. This exercise helps in stretching and strengthening the upper back muscles, which can alleviate the neck hump. Hold this position for about 30 seconds while breathing out [Video 1: T43753AfaKY, Time: 03:28-03:36].\n\nAdditionally, incorporating floor angels can be beneficial. This exercise involves lying on your back and moving your arms in a \"snow angel\" motion while keeping your elbows and wrists in contact with the floor. This helps to open up the chest and strengthen the shoulder stabilizers, which are crucial for maintaining good posture [Video 3: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 11:58-12:01].\n\nIn summary, performing wall slides and floor angels can significantly enhance your posture and help reduce the neck hump by strengthening the relevant muscle groups and promoting better alignment.",

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all.

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back.

So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight now the whole thrust expires from the top to the bottom. And it's very very simple. So what you do? You raise your arms in the air, hand palms facing forward, arms in the air, and you really pull your arms backwards. Keep your elbows straight, pull your arms backwards, and hold this for about 30 seconds if you can. And then from the",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

      "answer": "To improve posture and reduce the neck hump, engaging in specific exercises is essential. One effective exercise involves using a tennis ball. You can perform this by sitting on a bench or chair with your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinching a tennis ball between your heels. This action encourages slight foot e-version, which helps in aligning your posture better and reducing strain on the neck area [Video 2: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 01:28-01:38].\n\nAdditionally, it is crucial to focus on maintaining an upright posture throughout your daily activities. This means being conscious of your body alignment, ensuring your shoulders are back and your head is aligned with your spine. Such practices can significantly contribute to alleviating the dowager's hump and improving overall spinal health [Video 1].\n\nIn summary, incorporating exercises like the tennis ball pinch while being mindful of your posture can effectively reduce neck humps and enhance your overall posture. Regular practice of these techniques is key to achieving lasting improvements.",

Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all.

So you pull your arms back and make sure your elbows are pointing down, And the same thing, hold this for about 30 seconds. Now after 30 seconds, you spread out your arms. Elbows over your palms still facing forward. So you make a T, Y, W, T. So again, pulling your arms back again and 30 seconds. And then we're going down to the L. Elbows in the side, arms out and really pull your arms before arms back. And that's an L position. And again, hold that for about 30 seconds. So that's exercise number one. Y-W-T-L, really good exercise to get rid of that. That was just hump in the back of your neck. The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm.

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

      "answer": "To improve posture and reduce the neck hump, a simple exercise using a wall involves arm positioning. Stand with your back against the wall, and raise your arms to form a \"Y\" shape, with palms facing forward. Hold this position for 10 seconds and repeat it five times. This exercise engages the muscles in your upper back and shoulders, promoting better alignment and reducing forward head posture, which contributes to the neck hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 03:11-03:16].\n\nAdditionally, maintaining this position helps to stretch the chest muscles and strengthen the upper back, which can alleviate discomfort associated with poor posture. Regular practice of this exercise can lead to improved spinal alignment and overall posture. \n\nIn summary, using the wall to perform the \"Y\" arm exercise can effectively enhance posture and mitigate the neck hump by strengthening the relevant muscle groups and promoting proper alignment. Regular repetition of this exercise is key to achieving lasting benefits.",

It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all. And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

You can see that this is not a noxious thing. It's not causing me any discomfort. I'm still sitting here fairly carefully talking to you and not crying kicking your screaming. You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process.

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button down below and you can always find me at askdoctorjo.com. So we're going to start off with some stretches and then we'll move into the exercises towards the end. So the first stretch is an upper trap stretch. A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching",

          "text": "should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain.

It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover. Static Sub-Scaped Massage The Sub-Scaped Laris pain referral penance is meant in the rear shoulder and sometimes in the back of your wrist and have your arm up and reach in with your other thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade.

See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past",

Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching the top of my ear. Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

That's typically",

So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well.

Ensure your head is in a neutral position, aligned with your spine.\n\n2. **Performing the Chin Tuck**: Gently tuck your chin in towards your neck. Imagine creating a double chin without tilting your head down or back. This movement should be subtle and controlled.\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain the tucked position for a few seconds, focusing on feeling the stretch in the back of your neck. This helps strengthen the muscles that support your neck and improve posture.\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat the chin tuck exercise 10-15 times, ensuring you breathe normally throughout the process.\n\n5. **Posture Improvement**: Regular practice of chin tucks can help reduce the appearance of a neck hump and enhance overall posture, contributing to neck pain relief [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 09:47-09:50].\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid straining your neck or forcing the movement. If you experience pain, stop and consult a healthcare professional.",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early",

It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover. Static Sub-Scaped Massage The Sub-Scaped Laris pain referral penance is meant in the rear shoulder and sometimes in the back of your wrist and have your arm up and reach in with your other thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the",

A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40",

That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good.

Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

      "answer": "To apply chest compressions in an unconscious adult who is choking, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess the Situation**: Confirm that the adult is indeed unconscious and unable to breathe or cough effectively. If they are still able to cough, encourage them to continue as they may be able to expel the obstruction themselves [Video 2: PA9hpOnvtCk, Time: 01:06-01:20].\n\n2. **Position the Adult**: Carefully place the adult on their back on a firm surface. Ensure their airway is clear.\n\n3. **Perform Chest Compressions**: Using your upper body weight, deliver 30 chest compressions at a rate of about 100-120 compressions per minute. Compress downwards about 2 inches deep, allowing full chest recoil between compressions [Video 3: oIuGLGlQ2gg, Time: 01:56-01:58].\n\n4. **Open the Airway**: After completing the 30 compressions, perform a chin lift to open the airway. Check the mouth for any visible obstruction and, if present, carefully remove it [Video 3: oIuGLGlQ2gg, Time: 01:56",

So I continue with another 30 compressions, if the same depth at the same rate. After these 30 compressions, I go back, I look in the mouth, but this time I see something. So I reach in, I pull the object out, and I attempt a rescue breath. Let's see if we're successful. First breath goes in, second breath goes in. If the patient is not breathing normally at this point, not responsive, I go straight into my next 30 compressions. If the patient remains unresponsive, not breathing normally, I'm going to do 30 compressions followed by two rescue breaths, and I'm going to keep doing this 30 compressions to two rescue breaths until EMS arrives, help arrives, and AED arrives, or the victim becomes responsive and begins breathing normally on their own.",

Shake the inhaler well for 10 seconds. Turn your head to the side and breathe out. Close mouth around mouthpiece of spacer. Push down on the inhaler once. Now the medicine is inside the spacer. Right away, take a slow, deep breath. The goal is not to hear a whistling sound. If you do, this means that you're breathing in too fast. Hold your breath for a count of 10. Now slowly breathe out. Rinse your mouth out with water, or brush teeth, or get a drink after using controller medicines, such as inhaled steroids. Many times, the correct dose of your medicine will be to inhaled two puffs. If this is what is prescribed for you, then wait one minute after the first puff, and then follow all of the steps again.

How do you feel? Do you feel more awake? Do you feel more blood circulation on the neck, face and a scuff? Try it, whatever you need a little bit of left and also you need a little bit of more blood circulation and openness to the face and the scalp. Thank you so much for watching this video.

Instead, cover the person's nose and mouth with a CPR shield to create a seal. Attempt to deliver a rescue breath by blowing into the shield. Observe for chest rise and fall; if there is none, reposition the person's head and neck to open the airway better, and try again. If the breath still does not go in, and there is no chest rise, continue with chest compressions (30 compressions) until help arrives or the situation changes [Video 1: oIuGLGlQ2gg, Time: 02:01-02:03].\n\nIt is crucial to ensure a proper seal when delivering breaths and to monitor for effective ventilation. If the person becomes unresponsive, you should check their breathing and initiate CPR if they are not breathing normally. Always prioritize calling for emergency help if the situation does not improve [Video 3: PA9hpOnvtCk, Time: 01:51-01:56].",

We've lowered the patient down to the floor carefully using good ergonomics ourselves, protecting the patient's head and protecting them from trauma from them crashing to the floor. If we've not already called 911 or called the code, now is the time to do so. Once they're on the floor, we go straight into our chest compressions. We may notice that we have actually put on gloves because I know I'm going to be trying to pull an object out of the mouth if I've actually gotten one up and into the mouth. So it's good time to put your gloves on if you haven't already and have a CPR shield available and ready to use with a one-way valve. Keep in note here that when we do these chest thross or chest compressions, we're going to be going to a depth of 2 to 2.4 inches deep and we're going to do it at a rate between 100 and 120 times per minute. We're going to give our first 30 chance compressions, elbows locked, leaning over the victims chest, using our upper body weight to do the chest compression. One in, two in, three in, four in, five in, six in, seven in, eight, nine in, ten, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. After my 30 chance compressions, I head to chin lift, I open up the mouth.

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique.

If they become unresponsive, open the airway and check their breathing. If they're not breathing normally, start CPR. So remember, if someone's choking, cough it out, slap it out, squeeze it out. If it's not cleared, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Keep repeating the cycle. Start CPR if they become unresponsive, and that's how we treat choking.

I don't see anything so I'm not going to do a blind finger sweep. I cover their nose and mouth with my CPR shield and I attempt to rescue breath. I try the breath, nothing goes in, no chest rise and fall. I reposition their head and neck and try again. No breath goes in, no chest rise and fall. So I continue with another 30 compressions, if the same depth at the same rate. After these 30 compressions, I go back, I look in the mouth, but this time I see something. So I reach in, I pull the object out, and I attempt a rescue breath. Let's see if we're successful. First breath goes in, second breath goes in. If the patient is not breathing normally at this point, not responsive, I go straight into my next 30 compressions. If the patient remains unresponsive, not breathing normally, I'm going to do 30 compressions followed by two rescue breaths, and I'm going to keep doing this 30 compressions to two rescue breaths until EMS arrives, help arrives, and AED arrives, or the victim becomes responsive and begins breathing normally",

      "answer": "To open the nose through massage, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate Tender Spots**: Begin by gently pressing around the nose and face to find tender spots, known as trigger points. These areas may be sensitive and indicate where muscle tension exists [Video 2: 01:20-01:23].\n\n2. **Apply Pressure**: Once you identify a tender spot, apply gentle pressure. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds to allow the muscle to release. You can return to this spot 6-8 times to ensure effective release [Video 2: 01:20-01:23].\n\n3. **Massage Technique**: Start at the base of the nose in the fleshy area and gently massage over the skin. This technique helps to open the nasal passages. Ensure that you are using a gentle touch to avoid discomfort [Video 3: 03:24-03:28].\n\n4. **Breathing Exercise**: Incorporate a breathing exercise while massaging. For example, practice the 478 breathing technique: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, and exhale for 8 seconds. This can enhance relaxation and help open the nasal passages further [Video 1: ",

A lot of times this is a little more aggressive but it's my personal favorite way to straighten the entire spine. Last exercise that I want to demonstrate for you today is a superman exercise. You're going to be down here understanding once the end arm is extended over your head. Now what we're going to do is lift our arms and chest up off of the floor. Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees come up off of the floor. And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that,",

          "text": "Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields. Welcome to Day 5 of your 360 breathing. Today, I'd like you to either sit down with no back or stand up. I'm going to stand. You can go cross-legged on the ground also. Let's start with some breathing through your nose, with some massage on either side of your nose. Do some circular motions here. You know, this nose needs to be open. Sometimes I'll have people do breathing exercise just holding open like that. Let's get them open, just by doing some massage, do some deep massage, get a little vigorous with it. Today, we are going to do 478 breathing. You're going to do four seconds in, seven second, hold, and eight second out. 478 breathing. It's a good one. It helps balance out the nervous system kind of defrazzly. Give you a clear palate. So your nervous system is ready to function the way it needs to function. Go out a little bit, let's get that face. anything connected to the nose, let's get it open, good. Okay, now let's open the lungs a little bit in the back, right? 360 is 360 degree all the way around. So we're gonna take the hands like this, push the palms together, curl forward, take a big breath in through the back body, feel it tighten up, breathing out, Pushing the hands even harder together good now we're going to come back we're in a class that the hands together like this take a big breath in. Breathe out",

So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

This position helps to open up the chest area effectively. Keep your eyes level as you prepare to lean in [Video 1: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 02:38-02:42].\n\n2. **Lean In**: Gently lean into the corner, allowing your body weight to apply light pressure. This action helps to stretch the chest muscles and improve posture, facilitating better lung expansion.\n\n3. **Elbow Position**: For a more advanced technique, raise your elbows to shoulder level and keep your forearms parallel to the ground. This position can enhance the stretch and opening of the chest area.\n\n4. **Massage Trigger Points**: If you experience tightness or discomfort, consider massaging trigger points in the chest and surrounding areas. This can alleviate spasms and improve mobility, especially after injuries or surgeries [Video 3: 0CD3mYjPXxk, Time: 00:57-00:59].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always ensure that the individual receiving the massage is comfortable and does not have any underlying conditions",

The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight.

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of",

You can hold it upwards towards the minute, but we need to breathe out just lower your butt down like this. And then repeat it about three to five times. From there, you can just switch over different spots as needed. If it still feels like it does not watch release, what we can do from there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement. So this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like this. Create like a field goal position with my arms. Let my head go down towards the floor. And then just wing the elbows down towards the floor. What this will do is it stretches the chest, opens the pack up just a little bit differently. And that might get it to finally self release or pop. But challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can. You can hold this stretch for 15 to 20 seconds. Relax and then repeat. You can also do what our known as floor angels. So go down all the way right here. Lower the hands down towards, or I should say the back side are going",

Almost, if you have a wall or something behind you, you're chair behind you, just try and push your head into the wall or the chair. And you see, you have lots of little chins right there. And so you just wanna hold that position, you might feel some tightness in the back, you might feel some tightness in the front as well. And hold that for about three to five seconds, and then relax. You can do those five times, you can do them several times throughout the day. But again, you're just taking that chin, tucking it in, and getting that, you're working the muscles, and you're stretching the muscles at the same time. So it's a really great exercise, combination stretch, to really kind of reset everything. And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well.

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

Ooh, feeling the stretch all the way to the outer hip. Tighten your abs at the bottom of the breath. Big breath in. Let's go to the other side. Big breath in. Just rain going out those ribs, pushing the ribs out and up, arching up and over with some big breaths. Now let's get a little rhythm, come back to center, big breath into one side. Breathing out, coming back up, breathing into the other side. It feels good, big breath in. Now let's do some four seven eight breathing. So place the tip of your tongue right behind the right of the gum line behind the top And you're going to keep in there the whole time, okay? You're going to breathe in through your nose, hold for seven seconds and breathe out to your mouth, making a wushing sound, okay?

And then just wing the elbows down towards the floor. What this will do is it stretches the chest, opens the pack up just a little bit differently. And that might get it to finally self release or pop. But challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can. You can hold this stretch for 15 to 20 seconds. Relax and then repeat. You can also do what our known as floor angels. So go down all the way right here. Lower the hands down towards, or I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor. And then from there I'm going to wing my elbows down as much as I can. and then just raise my arms overhead just like this. You'll feel, again, the muscles just get hit a little bit differently, and that might just help. If you feel like it still needs a little bit more attention, you can put a little bit more of a passive stretch in there. So what I'm going to do is just allow my head and my shoulders to go all the way down towards the floor. I'm going to straighten my arms out like this, straight at the elbow, hands are going to overlap, and then I'm going to lower my hands down towards the floor as much",

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

And if that joint is locked up, this might get it too self-release. but you can hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds. If it feels good, hold it for longer. You can hold it upwards towards the minute, but we need to breathe out just lower your butt down like this. And then repeat it about three to five times. From there, you can just switch over different spots as needed. If it still feels like it does not watch release, what we can do from there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement. So this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like this. Create like a field goal position with my arms. Let my head go down towards the floor. And then just wing the elbows down towards the floor. What this will do is it stretches the chest, opens the pack up just a little bit differently. And that might get it to finally self release or pop. But challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can. You can hold this stretch for 15 to 20 seconds. Relax and then repeat. You can also do what our known as floor angels. So go down all the way right here. Lower the hands down towards, or I should say the back side are going",

Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching the top of my ear. Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one",

And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

      "answer": "To stretch the arms and breathe to relax the body, you can perform a simple sequence of movements. First, raise your arms overhead while inhaling deeply, stretching them as high as possible. As you exhale, lower your arms and give yourself a bear hug, wrapping your arms around your body tightly. This action not only promotes a sense of self-love but also allows you to lean to one side, enhancing the stretch in your side body. While in this position, take a few deep breaths, focusing on the areas where you feel the stretch [Video 1: M6UBlnV1Cyk, Time: 04:07-04:11].\n\nAdditionally, you can create a \"field goal\" position with your arms by bending your elbows and letting your head drop towards the floor. This position helps stretch the chest and opens up the pectoral muscles, which can contribute to relaxation and relieve tension [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 11:43-11:46]. \n\nIn summary, combining deep breathing with arm stretches, such as raising your arms overhead and giving yourself a hug, can effectively promote relaxation and relieve muscle tension.",

After my 30 chance compressions, I head to chin lift, I open up the mouth. I look in the oral cavity to see if I've gotten anything up out of the airway. I don't see anything so I'm not going to do a blind finger sweep. I cover their nose and mouth with my CPR shield and I attempt to rescue breath. I try the breath, nothing goes in, no chest rise and fall. I reposition their head and neck and try again. No breath goes in, no chest rise and fall. So I continue with another 30 compressions, if the same depth at the same rate. After these 30 compressions, I go back, I look in the mouth, but this time I see something. So I reach in, I pull the object out, and I attempt a rescue breath. Let's see if we're successful. First breath goes in, second breath goes in. If the patient is not breathing normally at this point, not responsive, I go straight into my next 30 compressions. If the patient remains unresponsive, not breathing normally, I'm going to do 30 compressions followed by two rescue breaths, and I'm going to keep doing this 30 compressions to two rescue breaths until EMS arrives, help arrives, and AED arrives, or the victim becomes responsive and begins breathing normally",

I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.

If they are coughing and encourage them to continue as they may be able to remove the obstruction, if they are unable to speak or cough, they need your help straight away. If coughing doesn't work, slap it out. Support the upper body with one hand and help them to bend forward. Use a heel of your hand to give up to five sharp back blows between their shoulder blades. Then check to see if there's anything in their mouth. If there is, tell them to pick it out. If back blows don't work, try giving up to five abdominal thrusts. Squeeze it out. To give With your domino thrust, stand behind them, put your arms around them and link your hands between their tummy button and the bottom of their chest. Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives.

About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a link right here. This is another one that you two think you might fix that you might like right here. So we sure to check that out and we'll see you again soon right here on tour with pain.",

We've lowered the patient down to the floor carefully using good ergonomics ourselves, protecting the patient's head and protecting them from trauma from them crashing to the floor. If we've not already called 911 or called the code, now is the time to do so. Once they're on the floor, we go straight into our chest compressions. We may notice that we have actually put on gloves because I know I'm going to be trying to pull an object out of the mouth if I've actually gotten one up and into the mouth. So it's good time to put your gloves on if you haven't already and have a CPR shield available and ready to use with a one-way valve. Keep in note here that when we do these chest thross or chest compressions, we're going to be going to a depth of 2 to 2.4 inches deep and we're going to do it at a rate between 100 and 120 times per minute. We're going to give our first 30 chance compressions, elbows locked, leaning over the victims chest, using our upper body weight to do the chest compression. One in, two in, three in, four in, five in, six in, seven in, eight, nine in, ten, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. After my 30 chance compressions, I head to chin lift, I open up the mouth. I look in the oral cavity to see if I've gotten anything up out of",

If they are coughing, support their efforts as they may be able to expel the obstruction themselves. However, if they cannot speak or cough, they require immediate assistance [Video 1: PA9hpOnvtCk, Time: 01:06-01:20].\n\nIf coughing does not resolve the choking, you can perform back blows. Position yourself behind the person, support their upper body, and deliver five firm back blows between the shoulder blades. If the obstruction persists, you should then perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver). To do this, place your arms around the person, link your hands between their navel and the bottom of their chest, and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeating this up to five times [Video 1: PA9hpOnvtCk, Time: 01:51-01:56; 01:34-01:36]. \n\nIf the person becomes unresponsive, check their breathing and initiate CPR if they are not breathing normally. Always call for emergency help if the blockage does",
