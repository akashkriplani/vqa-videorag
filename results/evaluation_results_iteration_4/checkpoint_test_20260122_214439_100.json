So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times.

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

      "answer": "To perform chin tucks for treating neck pain, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Sit or stand up straight with your shoulders relaxed. Ensure your head is in a neutral position, looking straight ahead.\n\n2. **Performing the Chin Tuck**: Gently draw your chin back towards your throat. Imagine creating a double chin without tilting your head up or down. This movement should be subtle and controlled, focusing on the muscles at the base of your skull and upper neck [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 08:19-08:22].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for a few seconds, ensuring you do not strain your neck. You can gradually increase the hold time as you become more comfortable with the exercise.\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat the chin tuck for 10-15 repetitions, performing this exercise several times a day to help improve posture and reduce neck pain [Video 3: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 09:47-09:50].\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience any pain or discomfort during the exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back.

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade.

Ensure your shoulders are relaxed and not hunched forward. This position is crucial for effective scapular retraction.\n\n2. **Engagement**: Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together and downwards. This action is essential as it counteracts the common forward shoulder posture that contributes to neck pain [Video 3: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 02:06-02:09].\n\n3. **Breathing**: While performing the retraction, breathe normally. Avoid holding your breath, as this can create tension in your neck and shoulders.\n\n4. **Duration**: Hold the retracted position for a few seconds (about 5-10 seconds) and then relax. Repeat this exercise several times throughout the day, especially if you spend long hours at a desk.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: If you experience any pain or discomfort while performing this exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. It\u2019s important to ensure that you are not straining your muscles during the exercise.\n\nIncorporating scapular retractions into your routine can help improve",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as well. So that's nice and straight. Eyes level, eyes forward, chin up. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and back. The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder",

Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button down below and you can always find me at askdoctorjo.com. So we're going to start off with some stretches and then we'll move into the exercises towards the end. So the first stretch is an upper trap stretch. A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching",

      "answer": "To perform corner stretches for neck pain, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find a Corner**: Locate an open corner in your home or office where you can comfortably position yourself without obstruction. Ensure the area is safe and free from hazards.\n\n2. **Position Yourself**: Stand facing the corner, keeping your feet shoulder-width apart. Maintain a neutral spine and keep your eyes level throughout the stretch.\n\n3. **Lean In**: Gently lean your body into the corner. Start with a light lean to avoid strain. This position helps to stretch the chest and shoulder muscles, which can become tight and contribute to neck pain [Video 2: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 02:38-02:42].\n\n4. **Advanced Position**: For a more advanced stretch, raise your elbows to shoulder level and position your forearms against the walls of the corner. This will deepen the stretch in your chest and shoulders, promoting better posture [Video 2: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 02:38-02:42].\n\n5. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain the stretch for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply to relax your muscles.\n\n**Safety Note**:",

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on top of your shoulder. So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all.

Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

      "answer": "To put on a clavicle brace, start by ensuring that the brace is in a figure-eight shape. First, take the end of the left strap and thread it through the left side of the plastic triangle buckle, securing it with the Velcro closure. Repeat this process for the right strap. Once both straps are secured, you can adjust the fit by pulling the straps tighter or loosening them until you achieve the desired level of clavicle and posture support [Video 2: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 01:31-01:35].\n\nThe clavicle brace is designed to stabilize the collarbone area after a fracture, promoting healing by keeping the shoulders back and maintaining proper alignment. This is particularly important for individuals recovering from high-impact sports injuries, as it helps to immobilize the area effectively [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 00:46-00:49].\n\nIn summary, putting on a clavicle brace involves threading the straps through the buckles, securing them with Velcro, and adjusting for comfort and support. This process is crucial for ensuring proper healing of the clavicle.",

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll them forward so they're really good at creating neck pain. The middle traps actually squeeze the shoulder blades together. And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym",

Wash your hands, introduce yourself to the patient, and obtain consent for the examination. This is crucial, especially since the examination is primarily conducted from behind the patient [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Have the patient seated comfortably, ideally with their shoulders relaxed. This positioning allows for better access to the supraclavicular area.\n\n3. **Palpation Technique**: Stand behind the patient and use your fingers to palpate the supraclavicular fossa. The supraclavicular lymph nodes are located above the clavicle, and you should examine them bilaterally for any abnormalities. Use a gentle but firm touch to feel for any enlarged or tender nodes [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 02:04-02:13].\n\n4. **Documentation**: Note any findings, including size, consistency, and tenderness of the lymph nodes.\n\nAlways ensure the patient feels comfortable throughout the examination, and communicate findings clearly. This approach will help in accurately",

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

Obtain informed consent for the examination, as this is crucial for patient comfort and trust [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Position the patient comfortably, ideally seated or lying down, to facilitate access to the neck area. It is important to approach the examination from behind the patient for better access to the lymph nodes.\n\n3. **Palpation Technique**: Use your fingers to palpate the submental lymph nodes, which are located beneath the chin. Ensure you examine them bilaterally for comparison. The submental nodes are distinct from the submandibular nodes, which run along the jawline [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 02:04-02:13].\n\n4. **Assessment**: Assess the nodes for size, tenderness, and mobility. Document any abnormalities.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: After the examination, thank the patient and ensure they are comfortable before leaving.\n\nAlways maintain a professional demeanor throughout",

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

The cervical lymph nodes are arranged in a z-shaped pattern along the side of the neck, located deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscles and superficial to the scalene muscles [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 02:04-02:13]. \n\nUsing your fingers, palpate the lymph nodes bilaterally. Focus on the submandibular lymph nodes, which run along the jawline, and examine them carefully. Apply gentle pressure to assess for any enlargement, tenderness, or irregularities. \n\nThroughout the examination, maintain a professional demeanor and ensure the patient feels comfortable, as this can help in obtaining accurate findings. Always be mindful of the patient's privacy and dignity during the process.",

Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this while off and you'll see how easily it snaps off and goes into your tube.",

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

This is crucial as the examination involves accessing areas behind the patient [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Have the patient seated comfortably. Position yourself behind the patient to access the lymph nodes effectively.\n\n3. **Locating the Nodes**: The preauricular lymph nodes are located just in front of the ear, while the postauricular lymph nodes are situated behind the ear. Use your fingers to palpate these areas gently.\n\n4. **Examination Technique**: Use your fingertips to feel for any swelling or tenderness in both the preauricular and postauricular regions. It\u2019s important to examine bilaterally to compare both sides for any abnormalities [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 02:04-02:13].\n\n5. **Documentation**: Note any findings, including size, tenderness, and mobility of the lymph nodes, as part of the patient\u2019s",

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

Wash your hands, introduce yourself to the patient, and obtain consent for the examination. This is crucial as much of the examination occurs from behind the patient, which requires their comfort and cooperation [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Have the patient sit comfortably, preferably with their back to you, to facilitate access to the occipital region.\n\n3. **Locating the Nodes**: The occipital lymph nodes are located at the base of the skull, just above the nape of the neck. \n\n4. **Examination Technique**: Use your fingers to palpate gently in a circular motion around the occipital area. It is important to examine both sides bilaterally to compare any differences in size or tenderness [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 02:04-02:13].\n\n5. **Documentation**: Note any abnormalities such as swelling or tenderness, which may indicate infection or other medical conditions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively",

Anyways, she went to the college. We kept her awake many nights from our snoring. Not just me, but my wife as well. And so it's a problem. So, why do you snore? It happens because when you fall asleep, the muscles in your throat, they relax, and with open mouth breathing, it starts to get these vibrations, and you know, it can be like, my dad was just as a chainsaw, you know? All right. How many cords would you cut last night, dad? Yeah, I had a friend that stayed in our cabin. It was, it was unreal. It was a phenomena. I mean, did you hand out your plugs? Oh, I mean, I had door shut, and you could hear him. I mean, Yeah, I mean, I think the towel is complaining. Yeah, we don't want to talk about it, right? So I would make the news.

Right, I'm sure all can all enhance that, so we had to move our happy hour, you know, from six o'clock in the three o'clock. You'll eliminate that, you know, it's five o'clock somewhere And then again the same thing and this actually you tried to tape it. Yeah, I got to admit It worked I think it worked better for snoring that because you still I will find myself breathing this way So I get it, not near as bad, but they're still a little dry mouth issues with this, but it's, you know, again, it's where they try it, it made do very well for the obvious joke is Brad that's a wife requested that you wear the tape all day long and maybe a bigger piece, I mean, I'm sure that's come across or mine. It's pretty funny, you got to bet it, get the tape, get the tape. It's time to hold the tape, but it makes the slave from the bedroom amazing.

You know, cool, I've got, you made me understand why I don't need a crown, but what am I supposed to do? I believe that most dentists that are really providing the most conservative care are going to be comfortable doing three-quarter crowns or partial crowns that don't cut down the backside of the tooth. And they will also be able to do veneers. and veneers are just maybe similar to a three-quarter pound, maybe even a little more conservative than that in their prep. These are great ways to avoid long-term challenges or problems with your teeth. So I would encourage you to go to a dentist who has the ability to create same-day restorations. That'll be a big benefit to you. And go to a dentist who understands how to prepare teeth for veneers and doesn't require or recommend crowns when the backside of the tooth is healthy. The topic of this video came up from just this last week. I had a patient come in and had some concerns with their smile and wanted to improve it. And they came to me and they were fairly young and they were recommended to have. I believe it was like 20 crowns performed and prepped on their teeth. And they were very young. Obviously it's a big concern to me. I advise",

So it actually stops that large inward curve in you like that. So lying down in this position. Coming down, now your forehead needs to be in contact with the ground, your arms are down and your palm are facing downwards. So I mean that position, now your head stays in contact with the ground during the whole exercise. The first exercise is to pull the shoulders away from the ears. Now can you try that at home or wherever you are? Head down, pull the shoulders away from your ears and then actually start to activate those lower trapezius muscles I was showing you on the diagram for earlier. Now second step is pull your shoulders away from your ears, squeeze your shoulders together and lift your hands just off the ground and now lower them down slowly and relax. Now you already know if you're doing this thing correctly. If you tend to be tight through upper traps, this is what you'll do. You'll lift and you'll pull up that way and",

And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

          "text": "muscles. These are called your trapezius muscles. Now there's three parts to these muscles and you need to know about all of them to properly address this problem. There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll them forward so they're really good at creating neck pain. The middle traps actually squeeze the shoulder blades together. And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym",

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

This position helps engage the middle and lower trapezius muscles, which can aid in relieving tension in the neck area. You may want to place a pillow under your pelvis for added comfort and support [Video 1: PdMJAhD7NEw, Time: 02:33-02:37].\n\n2. **Engagement**: While in this position, focus on gently engaging your shoulder blades together. This action can help activate the muscles that support the neck and upper back, potentially reducing tension.\n\n3. **Breathing**: Incorporate deep, slow breathing while maintaining this position. This can help relax the muscles further and promote overall relaxation.\n\n4. **Duration**: Hold this position for a few minutes, ensuring that you are comfortable and not straining your neck. If you feel any discomfort, adjust your position or take breaks as needed.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always listen to your body. If you experience pain rather than relief, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively work on reducing neck tension while lying",

We know how L5 was down at the top of your foot if you feel symptoms there, right? So where you're having the pain, it could be where you're having the pinched nerve but quite often it isn't.

So a lot of people may not be aware of this, but oftentimes there's something called referral pain, the repane refers down to the shoulder blade area. That's very common. I can come over this way under the shoulder as the blue tape shows. And then if it's a nerve and it's pinched pretty bad, it's very common that it's going to go down the arm. Now it may be in the front of the arm, not always in the back, like we have it here, but down the arm and down the one to the wrist and actually up into the fingers. And that's where a neck problems and carpal tunnel can cross over symptoms, so that's something we have to be careful of. And it can also be, say, between the shoulder blades, too, Ben? Yeah, I don't have, we don't have a piece of tape for that, but yeah, they could radiate down into or refer down to it as well. So those are the common areas, and if your pain is getting worse, it's going to go further down. Right. Right. It's pretty much a rule, thumb that can be relied",

What is sciatic and well-explained or numbness or can you leave them run down the back your leg? Most of the time caused by some problem of your your core back. If we can teach you the right strengthening and stabilization exercises to help minimize some of that problem, you're going to feel a lot better. That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better.

      "answer": "To identify if you may have a pinched nerve, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess Pain Location**: Pay attention to where you feel pain. Is it in the front or back of your arm, or inside or outside of your leg? The specific location of the pain can help determine which nerve may be affected. This is a critical step for both therapists and physicians in diagnosing nerve compression [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 02:33-02:38].\n\n2. **Consider Symptoms**: Look for symptoms that can arise from nerve compression, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness along the nerve's path. For example, carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition where the median nerve is compressed, leading to symptoms in the hand [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 06:16-06:31].\n\n3. **Evaluate Activities**: Reflect on any repetitive activities you may have engaged in that could contribute to nerve compression. These activities can exacerbate symptoms and lead to a pinched nerve [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 06:16-",

If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Now this is different than snowing. This is something I really think you should talk to your doctor about to clarify any problems if you're a diabetic, it may be associated with it. If you had a stroke, which you'd probably know, that could be at, or medication. Yeah, we see that a lot. And if you're medications to cause dry mouth, sometimes we may have a saliva gland that has a problem. Sure. You want to get that checked out. So, and again, dentist is probably the better source. Sure. And a medical doctor. Unless you got the medications from the medical doctor. Right. It's a good one to bring up with the doctor. either one. And see what they think. Right. If you're a healthy person, you're not taking beds. In my case, you know, it's like, I feel as far as I know, I'm healthy and I keep tracking myself.

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs. Where are from the back to the legs are you getting a pinch of hair and which we use you call sciatica sure The other thing we thought we talked about a couple fun ones right, Brad With this some names out there for nerves that could pinched and these are the ones that are generally more of a tempered pinch But what does call serenity policy? And this is apparently what happens if you fall asleep like on a bar or over the over a chair Like that on the back of your arm there that's a radial nerve palsy and you'll wake up and you're so drunk and you don't wake up at all.

      "answer": "To identify if you may have Saturday night palsy, you should look for specific symptoms associated with radial nerve palsy. This condition often occurs when pressure is applied to the radial nerve, commonly when someone falls asleep with their arm in an awkward position, such as over a chair or bar. \n\nKey signs to note include the inability to move your arm upon waking. You may experience a loss of movement in your arm, particularly in the wrist and fingers, leading to a \"wrist drop\" where the wrist cannot be lifted. This typically happens after a prolonged period of pressure on the back of the arm, which can occur during sleep when intoxicated or in an uncomfortable position. \n\nIf you find yourself waking up with these symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention. Early diagnosis and intervention can help prevent long-term nerve damage. Always be cautious about how you position your arms while sleeping to avoid this condition [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].",

Now this is different than snowing. This is something I really think you should talk to your doctor about to clarify any problems if you're a diabetic, it may be associated with it. If you had a stroke, which you'd probably know, that could be at, or medication. Yeah, we see that a lot. And if you're medications to cause dry mouth, sometimes we may have a saliva gland that has a problem. Sure. You want to get that checked out. So, and again, dentist is probably the better source. Sure. And a medical doctor. Unless you got the medications from the medical doctor. Right. It's a good one to bring up with the doctor. either one. And see what they think. Right. If you're a healthy person, you're not taking beds. In my case, you know, it's like, I feel as far as I know, I'm healthy and I keep tracking myself. I slowly look at my mouth open and that's why I snore, but then it's dry in the house. We don't have a dehumidifier going right now. Actually, we have a dehumidifier. You want you",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs. Where are from the back to the legs are you getting a pinch of hair and which we use you call sciatica sure The other thing we thought we talked about a couple fun ones right, Brad With this some names out there for nerves that could pinched and these are the ones that are generally more of a tempered pinch But what does call serenity policy? And this is apparently what happens if you fall asleep like on a bar or over the over a chair Like that on the back of your arm there that's a radial nerve palsy and you'll wake up and you're so drunk and you don't wake up at all.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So the first thing you're going to do is put on a turning kit, So we have to look for a vein, and the turning kit is going to go, this is going to increase to the elbow, it's going to go about three to four inches above it, and once you put time to turn it, show our exhibition if it's too tight, and then that's the patient to pop their fist a couple times, and she's going to pop it, we'll pop it in is where she's going to just feel for a vein, and the vein will bounce back on her fingers that sure know that's a good thing.

You may see in some other kits on the market. So just want to kind of demonstrate them, open them up and show you what they're used for. So take a look at the outside of the package here. This is the six-inch version here. This is a four-inch version. The four-inch version is what you're going to see in my Skinnymatic Pocket Kit. And I did include the six-inch version in my new kit, which is the Skinnymatic Essentials Kit. So we take a look at the outside of the package here. Same thing with the rest of North American's gear. You have red pull taps here. So either side can pull. So that way you get a visual of what you're going to grab a hold of. So it's got some interactions, it's a little hard to see, because everything's shrink wrapped airtight. But we're going to open up and show you how to use it here. So open up pull the red tap here. And then your compression bandage comes right out. So same thing with a 4 inch version here, pop right out. So once we get them open you can see the size comparison here. Obviously it's the 6 inch or 4 inch version. So this one appears your Israeli bandage is the one you are probably most familiar with. There's some",

      "answer": "To identify if you may have honeymoon palsy, look for specific symptoms associated with radial nerve palsy. This condition often occurs when pressure is applied to the radial nerve, typically from sleeping in an awkward position, such as resting your arm on a hard surface like a bar or chair. \n\n1. **Awareness of Position**: Consider how you were positioned while sleeping. If you fell asleep with your arm in a vulnerable position, this could lead to nerve compression.\n   \n2. **Assess Movement**: Upon waking, check if you can move your arm. A key indicator is the inability to move your arm or hand properly. You might experience weakness or a complete inability to move your arm, which is a sign of radial nerve palsy [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\n3. **Monitor Symptoms**: If you notice a \"tempered pinch\" sensation or weakness in your arm, it may suggest nerve involvement.\n\n4. **Seek Medical Advice**: If symptoms persist, consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and management options.\n\nSafety Note: Avoid sleeping in positions that put prolonged pressure on your arms to prevent nerve compression.",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So the first thing you're going to do is put on a turning kit, So we have to look for a vein, and the turning kit is going to go, this is going to increase to the elbow, it's going to go about three to four inches above it, and once you put time to turn it, show our exhibition if it's too tight, and then that's the patient to pop their fist a couple times, and she's going to pop it, we'll pop it in is where she's going to just feel for a vein, and the vein will bounce back on her fingers that sure know that's a good thing. So you never go by site, you always go by touch to feel for a vein. And he has a pretty good vein right in the middle and this is the vein that we this is the first vein that we use in full army.

Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives.

You see the tenders spot in you know, so if I'm doing it on myself I'm gonna follow on on the collarbone and I'm gonna find I know where it is on me And so here again I got my finger right on it now and now I'm going to put the other one top and now I'm going to rub it and it's sore It was your sore?

This is the six-inch version here. This is a four-inch version. The four-inch version is what you're going to see in my Skinnymatic Pocket Kit. And I did include the six-inch version in my new kit, which is the Skinnymatic Essentials Kit. So we take a look at the outside of the package here. Same thing with the rest of North American's gear. You have red pull taps here. So either side can pull. So that way you get a visual of what you're going to grab a hold of. So it's got some interactions, it's a little hard to see, because everything's shrink wrapped airtight. But we're going to open up and show you how to use it here. So open up pull the red tap here. And then your compression bandage comes right out. So same thing with a 4 inch version here, pop right out. So once we get them open you can see the size comparison here. Obviously it's the 6 inch or 4 inch version. So this one appears your Israeli bandage is the one you are probably most familiar with. There's some",

      "answer": "To identify if you may have handcuff neuropathy, look for specific symptoms associated with nerve compression, particularly in the radial nerve. One common scenario is when you fall asleep with your arm in an awkward position, such as resting on a bar or chair. This can lead to radial nerve palsy, which is characterized by an inability to move your arm upon waking. You may experience a \"tempered pinch\" sensation, indicating nerve compression [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\nTo assess your condition, try moving your arm and fingers. If you find that you cannot move them at all or only partially, this could be a sign of nerve involvement. It is crucial to monitor these symptoms closely, as prolonged nerve compression can lead to more severe complications. If you experience persistent numbness or weakness, seek medical attention promptly to prevent long-term damage [Video 1]. Always ensure that you change positions regularly to avoid prolonged pressure on any nerve.",

And all I'm longing, you're afraid to get away from her, and there's a joke too about non-hoffware or whatever. That also causes a pausing in your arm. Another one is, could be related as a handcuff neuropathy. There are two types that can actually put pressure on the nerves. And the last one we're going to mention is a crutch pausing, which we have some crutches here, here, but that's why when you use crutches, we try to teach you that you're really not trying to hang on to them or lean on to them onto them.

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

It causes your feet to roll inwards and create a typical portion where you need bow in. And that can cause stress and strain in your hips and lower back as well. It shifts your weight into other structures such as ligaments, joints, and muscles have compensate and that can cause pain and also promote arthritis or degenerate change. A lot of people will self-dognose themselves for fasciitis which is a irritation of the connective tissue under their foot and I'm going to show you in this video some short-term things you can do to prevent this pain or improve this pain. I hope these exercises and stretches help you as much as they helped me and my patients. Kind of raises with a ball. Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down.

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Show you some exercises you can do at home, and then we're going to show you a set set here that was actually provided us to us by F.E.I. again. F.E.I. Fabrication and Apprises Incorporated. This is the catalog. If you are a therapist, I would highly suggest that you grab one and get one. Sure. You go to their website. We'll put that link below, all right. And but they gave us all this stuff. We're not getting paid for this. But we don't get paid for anything to do with that. No, but we only like to represent quality, our products that we like, the good quality products. And we feel good about giving a little bump to them. Plug to them, yeah. OK. By the way, they provide some of these proxure retailers too. And stuff. Sure. Yeah, these will probably be used mostly for therapists. I don't think people are going to buy these for an individual at home if they had an accident or rehabbing, but then at least you'll know what they're looking, which you're looking at when you go to",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down. Come high as high as you",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

No, but we only like to represent quality, our products that we like, the good quality products. And we feel good about giving a little bump to them. Plug to them, yeah. OK. By the way, they provide some of these proxure retailers too. And stuff. Sure. Yeah, these will probably be used mostly for therapists.

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than",

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe,",

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough.

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were?

If you need to cleanse, use a gentle low pH cleanser and do not scrub at any lines drawn on your skin. Moisturizer can help your skin heal more quickly after treatment. Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

      "answer": "To wash your skin after radiation therapy, follow these steps for effective care:\n\n1. **Daily Washing**: It is essential to wash your skin daily to maintain cleanliness and promote healing. Use your hands to splash lukewarm water on the affected areas. Avoid using washcloths, sponges, or loofahs, as these can irritate the skin further [Video 1: M6WV95X0fRk, Time: 00:37-00:40].\n\n2. **Cleansing**: If you feel the need to cleanse your skin, opt for a gentle low pH cleanser. This type of cleanser is less likely to disrupt the skin's natural barrier, which is particularly important during radiation therapy. Be careful not to scrub at any lines that may have been drawn on your skin for treatment, as this can cause irritation [Video 1].\n\n3. **Moisturizing**: After washing, applying a moisturizer can help your skin heal more quickly. Choose a fragrance-free and hypoallergenic moisturizer to minimize the risk of irritation [Video 1].\n\n4. **Avoid Irritants**: Always be cautious about products you apply to your skin during this time, as your skin may be more sensitive",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief.

There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll them forward so they're really good at creating neck pain. The middle traps actually squeeze the shoulder blades together. And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

You may want to lean slightly forward to facilitate the stretch. Ensure your back is straight to avoid any strain [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41].\n\n2. **Arm Placement**: Bend your right arm and place your right elbow on the inside of your right knee. This position will help you create a rotational stretch in your upper back [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 07:54-07:58].\n\n3. **Press and Rotate**: Gently press your right elbow into your knee while rotating your torso towards the left. You should feel a stretch in your upper back. Hold this position for a few seconds to maximize the stretch [Video 2].\n\n4. **Experiment with Angles**: To enhance the release, lean your body slightly towards one side (e.g., right) and then the other (e.g., left). This variation allows you to target different areas of tightness in your upper back [Video 3: _",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated.

We're also going to start off on our knees, so make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath them for extra comfort. Let's go right up to that flat elevated surface. I'm going to bend the arm like this and place the back side of my arms flat on that elevated surface. Let's press down a little bit too just to create a stable anchor point. My hands, they're going to go on my upper back right across the shoulders just like this. From here, I'm going to tuck my chin towards my chest. The movement is very easy. I'm just going to simply lower my body weight, kind of like taking my butt down towards my heels. Also during this, I'm going to let my chest go towards the edge of that flat elevated surface as much as we can. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a good stretch happening into the upper back, the goes all the way down to the middle and lower back. It usually feels really good.

You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back.

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there.

I'm just going to press into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press down for stable anchor point. Let's take the hand that's closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge. Just for a little bit more support. What I'm going to do from there is bend the other sides arm, so in this case, I'm going to take my right elbow and I'm going to place it on the inside of my right knee.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

For comfort, place a pillow or towel underneath your knees [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 03:06-03:08].\n\n2. **Hand Placement**: Lean forward and place your hands on the edge of the bed. Ensure that the surface is flat and elevated; you can also use an armrest, desk, or chair if needed [Video 1].\n\n3. **Movement**: Gently lower your chest towards the bed while keeping your hips above your knees. This will create a stretch in your upper back. You can slide down a little further for a deeper stretch, but only go to your comfort level [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 02:19-02:23].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Perform this movement for about three to five repetitions, focusing on the areas that feel tight or painful. Move up and down to target different spots in your upper and middle back [Video 1:",

What you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little bit differently. So experiment with different angles. Go all the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the left. If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

So I'm putting my Y or my arms into a Y, my feet go together and then I'm just is using my body weight to lean forward towards the corner of that wall. This feels really good. You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there. And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release. So here is what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch, and it's a very good upper back opener",

From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards the left. From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So for demonstrated purposes, I will be using my can of soup. So if you are using the soup can, just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like this and then roll it up and you kind of have a homemade foam roller. So there I'm just going to position it right on the upper back. So I just go",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up.

Raise your arms to form a \"Y\" shape, extending them upwards [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 06:25-06:27].\n\n2. **Lean Forward**: Gently lean your body weight into the corner while maintaining the \"Y\" position with your arms. This action helps to stretch the upper trapezius and opens up the back [Video 2].\n\n3. **Experiment with Angles**: While leaning, you can experiment by shifting your body slightly to the right and left. This variation can help target different areas of tension in the upper back [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 04:34-04:36].\n\n4. **Incorporate Rotation**: For an added stretch, bend your opposite arm and place your elbow against your knee while pressing into it. This will enhance the stretch and rotation in your upper back [Video 3: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time:",

If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

So I'm putting my Y or my arms into a Y, my feet go together and then I'm just is using my body weight to lean forward towards the corner of that wall. This feels really good. You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there. And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release. So here is what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch, and it's a very good upper back opener",

If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

This setup allows you to effectively use your body weight for the stretch [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 06:25-06:27].\n\n2. **Form the Y Shape**: Raise your arms above your head to create a \"Y\" shape with your body. Ensure your arms are extended and aligned properly [Video 2].\n\n3. **Lean Forward**: Gently lean your body weight into the corner of the wall. This action helps to stretch and release tension in your upper back [Video 2].\n\n4. **Experiment with Angles**: While leaning, you can shift your body slightly to the right or left. This variation can help target different areas of tightness in your back. Try leaning towards each side to find the most effective angle for relief [Video 3: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 04:34-04:36].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you do not overextend or push too hard into",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

So I'm putting my Y or my arms into a Y, my feet go together and then I'm just is using my body weight to lean forward towards the corner of that wall. This feels really good. You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there. And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release. So here is what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch, and it's a very good upper back opener",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

This position helps to open up the upper back [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 06:25-06:27].\n\n2. **Bend and Rotate**: Next, bend your right arm and place your right elbow on the inside of your right knee.

Ensure that you are breathing deeply and maintaining a relaxed posture throughout the stretch [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 07:54-07:58].\n\n**Safety Considerations**: Always listen to your body and avoid pushing into pain.

If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards the left. From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover. Static Sub-Scaped Massage The Sub-Scaped Laris pain referral penance is meant in the rear shoulder and sometimes in the back of your wrist and have your arm up and reach in with your other thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief. If the exercise is held, please support the channel by giving this video like and maybe subscribing to the channel too. If you have any comments or questions, please leave them below. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for",

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

Doctor of physical therapy, tone and time, and in this video I want to share with you five of the best core strengthening exercises for your sciatic nerve pain. What is sciatic and well-explained or numbness or can you leave them run down the back your leg? Most of the time caused by some problem of your your core back. If we can teach you the right strengthening and stabilization exercises to help minimize some of that problem, you're going to feel a lot better. That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Ensure that your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed.\n\n2. **Arm Placement**: Bend your right arm and place your right elbow on the inside of your right knee. This positioning will help create a pivot point for your upper body [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 07:54-07:58].\n\n3. **Press and Rotate**: Gently press your right elbow into your knee while simultaneously rotating your upper body to the left. This action should create a stretch in your upper back and promote mobility. You should feel a significant stretch as you rotate [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 07:54-07:58].\n\n4. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for a few seconds, focusing on your breathing. Ensure you do not force the movement; it should feel comfortable yet effective.\n\n5. **Repeat**: You can repeat this exercise a few times on both sides to achieve balanced relief.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience any sharp pain",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards the left. From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover. Static Sub-Scaped Massage The Sub-Scaped Laris pain referral penance is meant in the rear shoulder and sometimes in the back of your wrist and have your arm up and reach in with your other thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

It's really tight, achy and painful and it needs a little bit more attention. Let's stop right over that spot. From there what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much as we can, really put the back into a backwards extension just like this, and then from there I'm going to plant my feet on the floor and then lift my butt up, kind of like creating a bridge like exercise. This time what's going to happen is that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the can into the floor, and it really intensifies the stretch. It feels really, really good for me. And if that joint is locked up, this might get it too self-release. but you can hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds. If it feels good, hold it for longer. You can hold it upwards towards the minute, but we need to breathe out just lower your butt down like this. And then repeat it about three to five times. From there, you can just switch over different spots as needed. If it still feels like it does not watch release, what we can do from there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement.

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

Now have you had the problem where you're repeatedly need to get treatment for getting tight neck and shoulders, you get your treatment, you have to go back, it feels great but you have to go back then a couple of days later to get treated again and the neck gets tight again. Today I'm going to show you a couple of simple exercises to get some permanent relief and to to overcome this typical problem of being tight through this area of your neck and shoulders all the time. So I'm going to talk about a couple of exercises and they really simple exercises you can start doing at home or in the gym for these muscles that we need to look at. Let's get started. Okay, so before we start, I just needed to bear with me for a moment so I can show you which muscles you're working and why. So this is the poster of this superficial outer back muscles and you can see in the purple clear these muscles. These are called your trapezius muscles. Now there's three parts to these muscles and you need to know about all of them to properly address this problem. There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll",

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

What are the things you're going to feel when you have a pensioner? One thing you might have quite often is pain because you're getting compression on a nurse. What is happening? And the nurse are coming out from your spinal cord and going from the spinal cord into your arms and into your legs. And in this area they wrap around the trunk. Sure, they wrap around the trunk. So you can get actually pain or compression of a nerve anywhere in the body in an essence, right? So let's start talking about some of the common symptoms you're going to feel.

Bend one arm, placing the elbow on the inside of the corresponding knee. For instance, if you bend your right arm, press your right elbow into your right knee. This action will create a stretch in your upper back while facilitating rotation towards the opposite side, enhancing mobility and relieving tension [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 07:54-07:58].\n\nThis technique engages both the thoracic spine and the surrounding musculature, promoting dynamic movement that can alleviate discomfort in the upper back. The combination of pressing and rotating helps to mobilize tight areas, providing instant relief from pain associated with stiffness or tension.\n\nIn summary, by bending one arm and pressing it against the knee while rotating towards the opposite side, you can effectively perform a dynamic extension exercise that aids in self-releasing the upper back for immediate pain relief [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41].",

Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt.

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

And all of a sudden the stuff starts to dissipate and you wonder, why the heck did the suction cup or skin pulling work with this thing, right? It's just a way to desense ties the area. So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations.

So with the suction cups you can go in and around first the area right here where we can do the tarsal tunnel and do some simple movements or even if you like, if you have problems with running, if you have problems with impact, put it on there and jog around. be surprised that it might just reduce and keep the camera where it's at right there. So as I stand right here and as I go through some lunging, okay, or as I go through some hop-in, this is all good and fine to do as well, move it down a little bit. Don't worry too much about the red dots, it's just blood kind of coming to the surface because it is a suction cup, but we're not trying to pull blood or anything like that or do any acupuncture, okay. So these are just simple things you can do with a suction cup. You can get them for like",

While the provided videos do not specifically detail skin rolling, Dr. Spashman mentions using a suction cup and fingers to alleviate inner ankle pain associated with running, particularly around the medial malleolus and into the arch or heel area [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 00:34-00:38]. \n\nThis technique may involve applying pressure and rolling the skin and underlying tissues to improve circulation, decrease tension, and promote healing in the affected area. Although the video does not explicitly describe skin rolling, the concept aligns with the principles of myofascial release, which can help alleviate pain by addressing tightness in the fascia and muscles surrounding the ankle.\n\nIn summary, while the specific method of skin rolling is not covered, using gentle pressure and manipulation techniques, as suggested by Dr. Spashman, can be beneficial in reducing ankle pain. For more detailed techniques, further resources may be necessary.",

Don't worry too much about the red dots, it's just blood kind of coming to the surface because it is a suction cup, but we're not trying to pull blood or anything like that or do any acupuncture, okay. So these are just simple things you can do with a suction cup. You can get them for like five bucks on Amazon, you get like a whole set. And you'd be surprised you do this pretty frequently throughout the day, like five times or so. And all of a sudden the stuff starts to dissipate and you wonder, why the heck did the suction cup or skin pulling work with this thing, right? It's just a way to desense ties the area. So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations. So that's really how you kind of lock these feelings in and make it feel better for the long haul. So if you guys like this, give me a thumbs up in this video and share it with a friend who's",

So as I stand right here and as I go through some lunging, okay, or as I go through some hop-in, this is all good and fine to do as well, move it down a little bit. Don't worry too much about the red dots, it's just blood kind of coming to the surface because it is a suction cup, but we're not trying to pull blood or anything like that or do any acupuncture, okay.

Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay?

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick.

In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started!

And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So for demonstrated purposes, I will be using my can of soup. So if you are using the soup can, just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like this and then roll it up and you kind of have a homemade foam roller. So there I'm just going to position it right on the upper back. So I just go",

It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover. Static Sub-Scaped Massage The Sub-Scaped Laris pain referral penance is meant in the rear shoulder and sometimes in the back of your wrist and have your arm up and reach in with your other thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

      "answer": "To reduce ankle pain using a suction cup, you can apply the suction cup to the skin around the affected area, particularly near the medial malleolus. This technique helps to mobilize the skin and underlying tissues, which can alleviate pain associated with conditions like plantar fasciitis or irritation in the ankle region. \n\nBegin by placing the suction cup on the skin and gently moving it around the ankle while also moving your toes. This action can help stimulate blood flow and relieve tension in the surrounding muscles and fascia [Video 2: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 01:23-01:29]. It's important to note that while using the suction cup, you may notice red dots on the skin; these are just signs of increased blood flow and are not harmful [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 02:06-02:09]. \n\nIn summary, using a suction cup in conjunction with gentle movement of the ankle can be an effective method to reduce pain and improve mobility in the area. Always ensure to use the suction cup correctly to avoid any discomfort.",

So on this model here you can see I'm showing you the back side of teeth. Very rarely do you get any sort of decay right where my finger is in this back side of the tip. And this is the area that is really important to maintain your natural tooth structure. Here's why it's so important. So if you look where my fingers are at, you can see all of this portion of the back of the side of the front teeth and I take this other model, which is the lower jaw and I put it together. One thing you'll notice is where do you chew? It's kind of hard to see maybe on this model there it is. You chew right up against the backside of those those front teeth. And so when you start grinding away to do a traditional crown on the backside of these front teeth, you're going to change that surface now to be something that is going to be a restoration that is chewing against your lower teeth that are natural. And that sounds okay except for the the fact that long term, this causes your lower teeth to get more wear and it's also likely to have wear on the backside of your restoration or chipping or breaking the crown over time because",

And that sounds okay except for the the fact that long term, this causes your lower teeth to get more wear and it's also likely to have wear on the backside of your restoration or chipping or breaking the crown over time because of the way that the bite connects. So hopefully that makes sense but that's one reason, that's this really the second reason why I would avoid crowns is that it changes the bite surface of your natural teeth to a prosthetic and it's really in an area that that's not super beneficial for you. Maybe even a third reason why you might want to avoid having a crown done on a front tooth. You've heard of the reason we would typically do a crown as to make it stronger, help hold a tooth together that's had a lot of decay or old restorations. And we would put the crown on top. And we put it on top and you have chewing forces like this. It's going, the crown's going to actually be giving that tooth additional strength. The fact that that tooth doesn't have a mammal there anymore is not too damaging, considering the forces this way. Now, if you take a front tooth, so you have a tooth in front where you, your forces really are more of this type of chewing forces where you go like that and you have",

You know, cool, I've got, you made me understand why I don't need a crown, but what am I supposed to do? I believe that most dentists that are really providing the most conservative care are going to be comfortable doing three-quarter crowns or partial crowns that don't cut down the backside of the tooth. And they will also be able to do veneers. and veneers are just maybe similar to a three-quarter pound, maybe even a little more conservative than that in their prep. These are great ways to avoid long-term challenges or problems with your teeth. So I would encourage you to go to a dentist who has the ability to create same-day restorations. That'll be a big benefit to you. And go to a dentist who understands how to prepare teeth for veneers and doesn't require or recommend crowns when the backside of the tooth is healthy. The topic of this video came up from just this last week. I had a patient come in and had some concerns with their smile and wanted to improve it. And they came to me and they were fairly young and they were recommended to have. I believe it was like 20 crowns performed and prepped on their teeth. And they were very young. Obviously it's a big concern to me. I advise",

Now, if you take a front tooth, so you have a tooth in front where you, your forces really are more of this type of chewing forces where you go like that and you have a little bit of lateral forces on the front teeth, those lateral forces on teeth that you've taken all the enamel away are not very healthy. And so I've seen a lot of patients who have had crowns on front teeth and their teeth are severely weakened and they will have the tooth break. And I'm wondering if they wouldn't have broken, if we would have been more conservative and kept the enamel on the backside of their front teeth. All right, so hopefully I made it clear why I'm apparently done, just gonna hang out. That's my dog, the extra, you can't see what we're in in the corner. Time. All right, so hopefully I've made the case for what are some of the risks or challenges and maybe why you shouldn't have a crown done on your front teeth. So then the question is, well, I've got some problems. I've got some tooth decay, I've got a fracture tooth. You know, cool, I've got, you made me understand why I don't need a crown, but what am I supposed to do? I believe that most dentists that are really providing",

Chances are if you've gone to your dentist or been concerned about having your front teeth addressed from tooth decay or even just not pleased with the way that they look, you may have been advised to get crowns done on your front teeth. There's some reasons why I would encourage a patient not to go down that route. Most of the time, we can avoid that. First, they're too aggressive. So when you are cutting on a tooth to prepare it for a crown, you have to remove almost all of the enamel. And this leaves the tooth more susceptible to fracture, more subtler break. It also would make the tooth likely to have more sensitivity and maybe even need a root canal in the future. So when you crown a tooth and you cut all the enamel away, it's definitely more likely to be a problem down the road. And you might ask yourself, so why in the world do we have to cut all the way around the tooth? And one of the reasons that we do that is for decades, we've not really had another solution to making the tooth have some sort of temporary why the lab makes your crown. And so we have to put a temporary plastic tooth on top of your existing prep on that basically the tooth that",

So each time you're getting this tooth treated, you're more likely to have it break, hurt, and have problems for you down the road. So just avoid crowns if you can, almost never needed. In dental school, we were taught how to prepare teeth for crowns and not for veneers. So you're gonna, most of the time, run into dentists that are really trained on crown prep and maybe not on veneer prep. And so crowns, you're going to basically take the burr, reduce the tooth about a millimetre on top and cut all the way around, essentially, removing all of your enamel. Now, if the tooth is badly damaged, then maybe this is necessary, The only area that really necessitates or requires us to be bad aggressive and removing the animal all the way around the tooth would be if you had tooth decay on the back side of the tooth and I was going to show that to you there. I don't know if I can focus. So on this model here you can see I'm showing you the back side of teeth. Very rarely do you get any sort of decay right where my finger is",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

      "answer": "Crowning of teeth can significantly alter the biting surface by affecting how the upper and lower teeth interact during chewing. When a crown is placed, it may not align perfectly with the natural occlusion, leading to uneven wear on the opposing teeth. Specifically, the restoration can cause the lower teeth to experience increased wear over time due to the altered biting dynamics. This can also lead to potential issues such as chipping or breaking of the crown itself, especially if the restoration is subjected to excessive forces from the natural teeth during chewing [Video 2: LL854--GBy4, Time: 05:52-05:54].\n\nMoreover, the crown's material and shape can influence the distribution of forces across the dental arch. If the crown does not match the natural contours and height of the original tooth, it can create pressure points that may lead to discomfort or further dental complications. In summary, while crowns are essential for restoring damaged teeth, they can change the biting surface dynamics, necessitating careful consideration and planning by dental professionals to ensure proper alignment and function [Video 2].",

Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first.

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

      "answer": "To strengthen the eyes during stroke therapy by following a finger, begin with a simple exercise that involves rolling your eyes in a circular pattern. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit comfortably in a chair, ensuring your back is straight and your head is stable. This will help you focus on the exercise without straining your neck.\n\n2. **Focus on the Finger**: Extend your arm and hold your finger in front of you at eye level. Ensure that your finger is clearly visible and not too far away.\n\n3. **Eye Movement**: Start by looking at your finger. Slowly roll your eyes in a circular pattern, moving your gaze all the way up, around to the side, and back down to the starting point. Repeat this motion several times, ensuring your eyes follow the finger smoothly and continuously [Video 1: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 00:31-00:40].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Perform this exercise for a few minutes, taking breaks if you feel any discomfort. It's important to maintain a relaxed posture throughout.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: If you experience any pain or discomfort during the exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional.\n\n",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

      "answer": "To strengthen the eyes during stroke therapy using a pen, follow these steps based on the exercise demonstrated in the video. First, hold a pen at arm's length in front of you. This will serve as your focal point. Next, begin by rolling your eyes in a circular pattern. Start by looking up at the pen, then move your gaze to the right, down, left, and back up to the starting point, completing the circle. This motion helps engage and strengthen the eye muscles. Repeat this circular motion several times, ensuring that you follow the pen smoothly with your eyes without straining [Video 2: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 00:31-00:40].\n\nImportant safety considerations include ensuring that you are seated comfortably to avoid any strain on your neck or back during the exercise. If you experience any discomfort or pain while performing the eye movements, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. Regular practice of this exercise can help improve eye coordination and strength, which is beneficial during stroke recovery.",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would take that measurement and then divide it into two. So if you had four inches on the ruler, you would take an actually mark on your swab where two inches would be. So in this case, you would mark right about the junction of the thick portion of the swab narrowing down. In the case of the adult on this particular swab that works",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

I'm here today to help produce a video To help train people have to do correct nasopharyngeal swabs. My expertise in point of care testing has had me to obtain several thousand of these. So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting",

And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists of nerves and blood vessels and it runs essentially from your neck into your shoulder and it can be compressed here, it can be compressed by a muscle or can be compressed by the clavicle or it can be compressed by the first rape even. And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder",

I'm now going to demonstrate inserting the swab correctly on myself and I'm going to show you how to do it where it causes a patient minimal discomfort and can easily be done in a type of setting. With the swab you're going to take it and very gently guide it into the air and you're going to feel it go just up and over at about this area you'll feel it just go over that little skin ledge at the bottom of the nose. At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates.

      "answer": "To measure the depth of insertion while collecting nasopharyngeal samples for flu testing, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Position the Patient**: Ensure the patient is comfortably seated with their head slightly tilted back. This position helps in accessing the nasopharynx more easily.\n\n2. **Insert the Swab**: Gently insert the swab into the nostril. According to the video, you should insert the swab horizontally once you reach the bottom of the nose. Continue to advance the swab until you feel the correct depth, which is typically just past the inferior turbinates [Video 2: kSpggqOLgaU, Time: 06:47-06:53].\n\n3. **Assess Comfort**: It is crucial to monitor the patient's comfort during this process. The insertion should not cause significant discomfort; the patient should be able to talk without distress [Video 2: kSpggqOLgaU, Time: 06:53-06:59].\n\n4. **Safety Precautions**: While performing the procedure, wearing gloves is recommended. In cases where there is a concern for more contagious illnesses, additional protective gear may be necessary [Video 3: kSpggqOL",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting",

Now the test you can do for that on the right side is literally put your right hand on your left shoulder and then raise your arm up.

So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on",

And so we have to put a temporary plastic tooth on top of your existing prep on that basically the tooth that we just cut now. And that plastic tooth has to have some sort of shape to hold on to. And so that's why we were taught in dental school to cut around the tooth to prepare it in a way that would hold the temporary. So we're really treating the tooth based off of our necessity to put a temporary on it. Now fast forward, right? The technology's come a long way. And now we can actually make the crown while in one visit, while you are here. And we don't require a lab to make the restoration anymore. So since we don't need a lab, you can imagine we don't have to have a temporary, and since we don't need a temporary, we don't have to shape the tooth the same way. There's a lot of benefits to you for that, because that means we only have to treat the portion of the tooth that gives you a the cosmetic benefit of changing the shade and the shape of the tooth, and be getting rid of the decay that's there. And so most of the time, we can do both of",

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is",

Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs. Where are from the back to the legs are you getting a pinch of hair and which we use you call sciatica sure The other thing we thought we talked about a couple fun ones right, Brad With this some names out there for nerves that could pinched and these are the ones that are generally more of a tempered pinch But what does call serenity policy? And this is apparently what happens if you fall asleep like on a bar or over the over a chair Like that on the back of your arm there that's a radial nerve palsy and you'll wake up and you're so drunk and you don't wake up at all.

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck. So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a",

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll them forward so they're really good at creating neck pain. The middle traps actually squeeze the shoulder blades together. And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym",

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

      "answer": "To avoid a crick in your neck, performing chin tucks can be an effective exercise to strengthen neck muscles and improve posture. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Begin by gathering a roll towel. This will be used to support your neck during the exercise. Lay flat on your back on a comfortable surface, bending your knees if necessary to protect your lower back [Video 2: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 00:48-00:52].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Place the roll towel behind the arch of your neck. This support helps maintain the natural curvature of your spine while you perform the exercise.\n\n3. **Chin Tuck Execution**: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest. This movement should be subtle; avoid forcing your head forward. The goal is to create a double chin effect, which engages the neck muscles without straining them [Video 2].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim to perform several repetitions of this exercise, ensuring that you maintain a relaxed posture throughout. Consistent practice can help reduce neck tension and improve overall posture [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 09:47",

Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice and tucked in, you hold this for five to ten seconds and you take it out again and do the same thing here. And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line. I hope you've enjoyed this video. I made to how to reduce your neck hump. I've done another video on this subject as well.",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

This position allows gravity to assist in the drops reaching the ear canal [Video 1: v0HODFTrkqs, Time: 00:18-00:24].\n\n2. **Visualize the Ear Canal**: Gently pull the ear upward and backward to straighten the ear canal, making it easier to see and access [Video 1].\n\n3. **Application of Drops**: Administer one drop into the ear canal. It\u2019s important to apply the drops carefully to ensure they enter the ear properly.\n\n4. **Facilitate Flow**: After applying each drop, press on the front of the ear. This action helps the drop travel down toward the eardrum, enhancing its effectiveness [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repeat**: Continue applying drops as directed, ensuring that all prescribed drops are placed in the ear.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always check the instructions for the specific ear drops being used, as some may have unique application guidelines. If there is any pain or discomfort, consult a healthcare professional.",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is",

So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on",

Place your lips tightly around the outside of the mouthpiece, ensuring your teeth are positioned behind the tabs. It\u2019s crucial that your tongue does not block the hole in the mouthpiece [Video 2: Zs8Fs5HaJHs, Time: 02:35-02:39].\n\n3. **Breathing Technique**: Begin with normal breathing to get accustomed to the mouthpiece. After a few breaths, take a deep breath in, then exhale forcefully into the mouthpiece as hard and fast as you can. This is typically done several times to ensure accurate results.\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: If you experience any discomfort, inform your healthcare provider immediately.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

So if you guys like this, give me a thumbs up in this video and share it with a friend who's experiencing some foot ankle, some planar fishitis, maybe some, um, tibial tendonitis into the foot area and they run and they're they're just frustrated, okay. You guys are looking for more information on how to resolve putting any conditions. I created a little mini guide for you on the corner here, pretty straight into the point. I'm in a very cheap, I made it so that basically it's all the stuff that you were looking for on YouTube, but we're really frustrated and you couldn't find it, because it's way too much damn sit on YouTube. So you're going to find it all right there. I laid it all out for you and I tried to break it down in this fashion, so not all the videos are They're just people that I've found that have done very good demonstrations such as this and you're gonna get a lot from it So if you like this share with friend, I'll see you guys next week",

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

It causes your feet to roll inwards and create a typical portion where you need bow in. And that can cause stress and strain in your hips and lower back as well. It shifts your weight into other structures such as ligaments, joints, and muscles have compensate and that can cause pain and also promote arthritis or degenerate change. A lot of people will self-dognose themselves for fasciitis which is a irritation of the connective tissue under their foot and I'm going to show you in this video some short-term things you can do to prevent this pain or improve this pain.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward",

      "answer": "To treat a foot sprain properly, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rest**: Limit movement and avoid putting weight on the injured foot. Sit whenever possible to promote healing. Rest is crucial as it allows the ligaments to recover [Video 1: bUgV89cdfTM, Time: 00:43-00:48].\n\n2. **Elevation**: Elevate your foot to the level of your chest. This can help reduce swelling and improve blood circulation to the injured area. Using a pillow under your foot while resting can facilitate this [Video 1: bUgV89cdfTM, Time: 00:43-00:48].\n\n3. **Ice**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided evidence, applying ice to the injured area can help reduce swelling and pain. It is generally recommended to ice the area for 15-20 minutes every few hours during the first 48 hours post-injury.\n\n4. **Compression**: Use an elastic bandage or wrap to compress the area. This can help minimize swelling and provide support to the injured ligaments.\n\n5. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: If pain persists or worsens, seek medical advice to rule out more serious injuries.\n\nFollowing these",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

And the nurse are coming out from your spinal cord and going from the spinal cord into your arms and into your legs. And in this area they wrap around the trunk. Sure, they wrap around the trunk. So you can get actually pain or compression of a nerve anywhere in the body in an essence, right? So let's start talking about some of the common symptoms you're going to feel.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down.

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before",

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

I'm probably just average, I spend an average of two hours 30 minutes per day looking at my phone. I just need to go outside, go to your local supermarket, just go outside and you see the majority of people looking at the phones this way with a head tilting forwards. Now you can do all the exercises in the world, but if you keep on looking at your phone with your head drop down, no way you're going to get rid of that hump for good. So what we need to do is next to the exercise, you need to find a way to look at your phone that places less pressure on your neck, and I've got the right hack for you. All you need to do, super simple, all you need to do is support the arm that holds your phone with the other hand to look. What I'm doing now is I'm supporting my elbow of the hand that holds my phone upright, suddenly my phone is upright, suddenly I'm not dropping my head forwards and not creating a lot of",

Okay, so before we start, I just needed to bear with me for a moment so I can show you which muscles you're working and why. So this is the poster of this superficial outer back muscles and you can see in the purple clear these muscles. These are called your trapezius muscles. Now there's three parts to these muscles and you need to know about all of them to properly address this problem. There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll",

          "text": "In this video, I'm going to demonstrate some really simple but yet highly effective exercises to get rid of your dowager's hump or your neck hump once and for all. So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before",

So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down. Come high as high as you",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe,",

So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when you're working, when you sit in front of your computer and from time to time, you do this exercise. So what you need to do is grab your wrist and place the arms behind you. You know, sit upright, grab your wrist. Really, really try to get your arms behind you as high as you possibly can. Sit upright, and then what you do is you tilt your head backwards. And you turn, left, and right. And you're definitely going to feel on here a bit of crunching when you're doing this. If it doesn't hurt, don't worry about it. It's good, it loosens tissue off. So that's actually fine. So really pull your arms up as high as possible you can and turn your head to the left and the right. You do this for about 10, 20, 30 seconds, but it's important that you try to do this throughout the day and it will help you and support the other exercise you're doing in the evening. I'm probably not telling you anything new, if I say that these little gadgets here play a big part in the creation of the",

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

      "answer": "To perform an advanced prayer exercise to reduce the neck hump, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Begin by standing or sitting upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Ensure your posture is straight, with your shoulders relaxed and down.\n\n2. **Arm Positioning**: Raise your arms above your head, bringing your palms together as if in prayer. This position helps to open up the chest and stretch the upper body.\n\n3. **Body Movement**: As you hold your arms overhead, gently push your upper body through your arms. It\u2019s crucial to keep your chin tucked in and avoid letting your head drop forward, as this can exacerbate the neck hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n4. **Duration**: Hold this position for about 10 seconds, then take a brief rest before repeating the exercise. Aim to perform this exercise multiple times for maximum effectiveness [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 03:54-03:58].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always listen to your body and avoid any movements that cause pain or discomfort. Maintaining proper posture throughout the exercise is essential to prevent further strain",

You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down. Come high as high as you",

Ensure your chin is tucked in to maintain proper alignment and prevent your head from dropping forward, which can exacerbate the neck hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n2. **Arm Movement**: Extend your arms out to the sides and then push your upper body through your arms. This action helps to open up the chest and stretch the shoulders effectively [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: As you hold this position, you should feel tension in the area of the neck hump. It is crucial to maintain the chin tuck throughout the stretch to avoid further strain on the neck [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n4. **Release**: After holding the stretch for a few seconds, gently drop any weights or props you might be using (like a book) to relieve tension [Video 1",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

Let's do the side and back of your head, right right here. from pushing the scalp and gradually oh, slide them up to the top. Okay, and don't hold your breath, that's also important.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

This technique allows you to keep the phone upright, preventing you from dropping your head forward, which can lead to increased strain on your neck. By supporting your elbow, you maintain a more neutral head position, thereby alleviating stress on the cervical spine and surrounding musculature [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 07:34-07:37].\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s important to be mindful of your posture throughout the day, as prolonged use of handheld devices can contribute to neck issues, often referred to as \"tech neck\" or the development of a neck hump. Regularly adjusting your position and taking breaks can help mitigate these effects [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 06:23-06:30].\n\nIn summary, by supporting your phone-holding arm and maintaining an upright phone position, you can significantly reduce neck strain while using your device. Regular posture checks and breaks are also beneficial for overall neck health.",

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck.

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down.

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back.

So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times.

Once you've gotten everything stretched out, warm it up first, get it stretched out, then you wanna go into the exercises. So one of my favorite exercises, if you've seen some of my videos for neck pains, it chin tuck. A chin tuck is really great because it's kind of a stretch and an exercise combined together, but it's a great way to help get you back and good posture. A lot of times with neck pain, it comes from people like this at either other computer or if they're focusing on something, they really bring that head forward and that puts a lot of stress on the neck causing pain. So a chin tuck is super simple. You've probably seen in some of my videos where I use my fingers at Target, you don't have to do that. The great thing about a chin tuck is you can do it anywhere is super easy, people might look at you a little funny when you're doing it, but it's easy to do. And so all you're doing is just like it sounds you're tucking your chin back and in, but it's not down towards your chest. So you're just taking your chin, keeping it level, you",

Absolutely. and such on the wrong direction quick. So the common causes of a pinch nerve in the neck are you could have a disc problem. You could have degeneration of the bones and to the point where they make the whole smaller where the nerves come out, or you could have thoracic outlets in them. That's where you get impenething between the collar bone and the first rib, right? So, and you could also just have compression of muscles. And in the neck, so there's more, but there's more. Yeah, I don't need the bore, that's right. So neck pain can vary in location intensity. It depends on your diagnosis, your age, and your posture.

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it.

The key movement involves tucking your chin straight back towards your throat, which helps realign the cervical spine and reduce forward head posture [Video 3: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 00:48-00:52].\n\nIncorporating this exercise into your routine can significantly improve neck posture and alleviate associated discomfort. The chin tuck works by mobilizing the cervical region, which is crucial for reducing neck humps and improving overall spinal alignment [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 01:49-01:46]. \n\nIn summary, the turbocharged chin tucks exercise is a straightforward yet effective method to enhance posture by focusing on the alignment of the neck and spine. Regular practice can lead to long-term benefits in reducing neck pain and improving posture.",

So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

How do you know if you're doing the right neck exercises or stretches? Sure. This is very important because if you're doing the wrong one, it can make it worse. Absolutely. and such on the wrong direction quick. So the common causes of a pinch nerve in the neck are you could have a disc problem. You could have degeneration of the bones and to the point where they make the whole smaller where the nerves come out, or you could have thoracic outlets in them. That's where you get impenething between the collar bone and the first rib, right? So, and you could also just have compression of muscles. And in the neck, so there's more, but there's more. Yeah, I don't need the bore, that's right. So neck pain can vary in location intensity. It depends on your diagnosis, your age, and your posture. But the common locations are, and I guess we got kind of, we met them out. We met them out. This is for a pinch nerve, but it's very common to have neck pain, of course, up in the neck itself.

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one.

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

      "answer": "To relieve discomfort from a rotator cuff issue using a thumb massage, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Locate the Subscapularis Muscle**: This muscle is part of the rotator cuff and is located beneath the shoulder blade (scapula). It's essential to identify this area for effective massage [Video 1: 00:41-00:45].\n\n2. **Apply Pressure**: Using your thumb, gently press into the subscapularis muscle. Be cautious, as this area can be quite sensitive and painful [Video 1: 01:20-01:23]. \n\n3. **Find Trigger Points**: As you massage, look for tender spots known as trigger points. When you find one, hold the pressure on that spot for 20-30 seconds. This helps in releasing muscle tension [Video 1: 01:20-01:23].\n\n4. **Repeat**: After holding the pressure, move to another tender spot and repeat the process. It\u2019s recommended to return to the original tender spot 6-8 times to ensure the muscle releases effectively [Video 1: 01:20-01:23].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always listen to your body.",

So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder.

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well.

We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center.

And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most.

And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on",

It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover. Static Sub-Scaped Massage The Sub-Scaped Laris pain referral penance is meant in the rear shoulder and sometimes in the back of your wrist and have your arm up and reach in with your other thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10 rotation before moving to the next spot. Because if you do have short issues, check out my fix my round the shoulder video, or even mobilise the shoulders with a power bag.

Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus.

They say, well, somewhere you have a pensioner. We're going to talk about where you can pensioner and what it is and what symptoms it is. So first let's talk about the symptoms. What are the things you're going to feel when you have a pensioner? One thing you might have quite often is pain because you're getting compression on a nurse. What is happening? And the nurse are coming out from your spinal cord and going from the spinal cord into your arms and into your legs. And in this area they wrap around the trunk. Sure, they wrap around the trunk.

Yeah, so like if you just have shoulder pain, and it keeps referring down the arm, that shoulder pain is getting worse. If you have just regular neck pain, not even a pinch nerve, but the pain is to go in further down the arm, it's getting worse. So, yeah, so if you're stretching your neck, and maybe the neck feels better, but the arm starts to feel worse or goes down the arm, that's a big risk of playing the side. And you need to stop that. Well, we're looking for is that your symptoms are going to improve the farthest away, where you're feeling. So like if I've getting symptoms all the way down here into the hand, what I want to see is the hand gets better first. Yep. Now that could be numbness or tingling or burn, or whatever. But you know if you do the exercise you go on, there's a little bit less burning there. Yep. But it's a little bit I can feel it now. Right.

You can go cross-legged on the ground also. Let's start with some breathing through your nose, with some massage on either side of your nose. Do some circular motions here. You know, this nose needs to be open. Sometimes I'll have people do breathing exercise just holding open like that. Let's get them open, just by doing some massage, do some deep massage, get a little vigorous with it. Today, we are going to do 478 breathing. You're going to do four seconds in, seven second, hold, and eight second out. 478 breathing. It's a good one. It helps balance out the nervous system kind of defrazzly. Give you a clear palate. So your nervous system is ready to function the way it needs to function. Go out a little bit, let's get that face. anything connected to the nose, let's get it open, good. Okay, now let's open the lungs a little bit in the back, right? 360 is 360 degree all the way around. So we're gonna take the hands like this, push the palms together, curl forward, take a big breath in through the back body, feel it tighten up, breathing out, Pushing the hands even harder together good now we're going to come back we're in a class that the hands together like this take a big breath in.

A common cause of first-degree burns is exposure to hot surfaces, such as curling irons or stoves, as well as sunburns. The affected area may appear red and feel tender to the touch, but these burns do not cause blisters or damage deeper layers of skin, which distinguishes them from second and third-degree burns [Video 1: ZNWjfe-84Ig, Time: 00:54-00:59].\n\nKey assessment criteria for first-degree burns include:\n- Skin color: Redness in the affected area.\n- Pain level: Tenderness and discomfort upon touch.\n- Swelling: Mild swelling may be present.\n\nWarning signs to monitor include:\n- Increased pain or sensitivity in the burn area.\n- Development of blisters or open wounds, which may indicate a more severe burn.\n- Signs of infection, such as increased redness, warmth, or pus formation.\n\nIf any of these warning signs occur, it is advisable to seek medical attention to prevent complications.",

          "text": "First degree burns are very common. Unlike second or third degree burns, first degree burns only involve the top layer of the skin. People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this.

      "answer": "To treat a minor burn, specifically a first-degree burn, it is essential to follow a few key steps. First-degree burns, which affect only the top layer of the skin, typically present as red, painful areas and can occur from sources like hot surfaces or sun exposure [Video 1: ZNWjfe-84Ig, Time: 00:54-00:59].\n\nThe initial treatment involves cooling the burn by running it under cool (not cold) water for about 10 to 15 minutes. This helps reduce pain and swelling. After cooling, gently pat the area dry and apply a soothing lotion or aloe vera to keep the skin moisturized and promote healing. Over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can also be used to manage discomfort.\n\nIt is crucial to avoid breaking any blisters that may form, as this can lead to infection. If the burn shows signs of infection or does not improve, seek medical attention. In summary, for minor burns, cooling, moisturizing, and pain management are key components of effective treatment [Video 1].",

Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives. If they become unresponsive, open the airway and check their breathing. If they're not breathing normally, start CPR. So remember, if someone's choking, cough it out, slap it out, squeeze it out.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Begin by running your fingers through your hair and applying light pressure to different spots on your scalp. This will help you identify any areas of pain or tightness, which could indicate tension or other issues [Video 2: _hb7isbiW3s, Time: 03:05-03:15].\n\nNext, use the pads of your middle fingers to firmly push down on the top of your head. While doing this, maintain an open chest and breathe out deeply. This technique can enhance blood circulation in your scalp, neck, and face, helping you feel more awake and alert [Video 3: _hb7isbiW3s, Time: 04:23-04:27]. \n\nIt's important to be gentle and avoid applying excessive pressure that could cause discomfort. Regularly checking your scalp can help you stay aware of its condition and promote overall scalp health. Remember, just as you care for your face, your scalp deserves attention too [Video 1: _hb7isbiW3s, Time: 00:45-00:51].",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4.

Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So you never go by site, you always go by touch to feel for a vein. And he has a pretty good vein right in the middle and this is the vein that we this is the first vein that we use in full army.

And you'd be surprised you do this pretty frequently throughout the day, like five times or so. And all of a sudden the stuff starts to dissipate and you wonder, why the heck did the suction cup or skin pulling work with this thing, right? It's just a way to desense ties the area. So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations. So that's really how you kind of lock these feelings in and make it feel better for the long haul. So if you guys like this, give me a thumbs up in this video and share it with a friend who's",

You can go cross-legged on the ground also. Let's start with some breathing through your nose, with some massage on either side of your nose. Do some circular motions here. You know, this nose needs to be open. Sometimes I'll have people do breathing exercise just holding open like that. Let's get them open, just by doing some massage, do some deep massage, get a little vigorous with it. Today, we are going to do 478 breathing. You're going to do four seconds in, seven second, hold, and eight second out. 478 breathing. It's a good one. It helps balance out the nervous system kind of defrazzly. Give you a clear palate. So your nervous system is ready to function the way it needs to function. Go out a little bit, let's get that face. anything connected to the nose, let's get it open, good. Okay, now let's open the lungs a little bit in the back, right? 360 is 360 degree all the way around. So we're gonna take the hands like this, push the palms together, curl forward, take a big breath in through the back body, feel it tighten up, breathing out, Pushing the hands even harder together good now we're going to come back we're in a class that the hands together like this take a big breath in. Breathe out",

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the",

One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot.

      "answer": "To perform a simple scalp massage that improves blood circulation, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit comfortably in a relaxed position. Ensure your shoulders are down and your chest is open to facilitate breathing and relaxation.\n\n2. **Finger Placement**: Use the mini part of your middle fingers to apply pressure. Firmly push down on the top of your head. This technique helps stimulate blood flow to the scalp and surrounding areas [Video 1: _hb7isbiW3s, Time: 04:23-04:27].\n\n3. **Breathing**: As you apply pressure, breathe out slowly. This not only enhances relaxation but also allows you to feel the effects of the massage more acutely. Pay attention to how your body feels during this process, particularly in the neck and face areas, as increased circulation can lead to a feeling of awakening [Video 1: _hb7isbiW3s, Time: 04:23-04:27].\n\n4. **Duration and Frequency**: You can repeat this massage for a few minutes, ideally whenever you feel the need to boost circulation or relieve tension.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you are not applying excessive pressure that could cause discomfort",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

          "text": "Welcome back to ActiveCardPractice guys and today I'm going to show you how to do massage for your sub-scapularic muscle and a sub-scapularic muscle is one of your rotator cuff muscles. It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover. Static Sub-Scaped Massage The Sub-Scaped Laris pain referral penance is meant in the rear shoulder and sometimes in the back of your wrist and have your arm up and reach in with your other thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade.

You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there. And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release.

Bye Okay, so a quick and the neck is usually a muscular thing and it typically happens in one or two ways. One is kind of a neck strain that you get from maybe lifting something too heavy or doing an exercise where you really kind of strain into your neck. And the second way is when you have your head in a position and it can be either way where the pain in the neck can come from this part of the side of the neck where the muscles have been compressed in or too short or it can be from this side where the muscles are stretched in too long. It's usually this side, I find, in most of my patients. So you will also feel a lot of times with neck pain. You also feel it kind of going down into the shoulder blade. So you can kind of see here this muscle here, the levator scape kind of comes off the vertebrae and comes down out to the shoulder blade. So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should",

Inhale deeply while squeezing, then exhale and let the shoulder drop. This helps in feeling the release of tension [Video 2: B9yiDTONlOs, Time: 01:56-02:00].\n\n3. **Repeat on Both Sides**: After releasing one side, switch to the other side. Perform the same squeezing and releasing technique, paying attention to how each side feels differently. This can help in balancing the tension across both sides of your neck and shoulders [Video 2].\n\n4. **Mindfulness**: While performing these steps, be mindful of your breathing and the sensations in your body. Notice any changes in tension levels as you progress through the exercises.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you are not applying excessive pressure that causes pain. The goal is to",

It's very important to use your inhaler the correct way to make sure the medicine gets deposited into the lungs where it works the best. In correct technique can leave some of the particles from the medicine on your tongue or throat, where it won't help at all. A spacer or holding chamber is an attachment that should always be used with your inhaler. The spacer holds the medicine in place so you can breathe it in easier. Now, let's demonstrate how to correctly use a spacer in mouthpiece. First, remove the cap from the bottom of your inhaler. When you get your new inhaler from the pharmacy, you need to prime or waste it by spraying the medicine into the air four times. Now, fit your inhaler into the opening at the end of the spacer. Shake the inhaler well for 10 seconds. Turn your head to the side and breathe out. Close mouth around mouthpiece of spacer. Push down on the inhaler once. Now the medicine is inside the spacer. Right away, take a slow, deep breath. The goal is not to hear a whistling sound. If you do, this means that you're breathing in too fast. Hold your breath for a count of 10. Now slowly breathe",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Then check to see if there's anything in their mouth. If there is, tell them to pick it out. If back blows don't work, try giving up to five abdominal thrusts. Squeeze it out. To give With your domino thrust, stand behind them, put your arms around them and link your hands between their tummy button and the bottom of their chest. Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives. If they become unresponsive, open the airway and check their breathing. If they're not breathing normally, start CPR. So remember, if someone's choking, cough it out, slap it out, squeeze it out.

Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice and tucked in, you hold this for five to ten seconds and you take it out again and do the same thing here. And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line. I hope you've enjoyed this video. I made to how to reduce your neck hump. I've done another video on this subject as well.",

And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional where you can go about and do your things but you're still either getting that heat if you need it or if you need that cold afterwards you can do that as well. And so it's really nice also because it's not plugged in so you can move around with it on you sometimes with traditional heating pads, you actually have to plug it in and stay in one spot, but you don't have to do it with that. They also come in different sizes in different colors. They have an extra large version. So if you need a little bit more length on the wrap around, you have that option as well. It also has that elastic band. So it's really nice. They use, you know, all natural products on the inside. So it's, you know, sometimes flaxseed, sometimes it's lavender. And so they they use different kinds with that as well. So if you're interested in purchasing their product, make sure and click on the link up there. So now we're gonna go into some exercises. Once you've gotten everything stretched out, warm it up first, get it stretched out,",

Shake it if necessary, as this helps mix the medication properly.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Turn your head to the side and exhale fully to empty your lungs. This prepares your lungs to receive the medication effectively [Video 2: ma_cmlU9DxU, Time: 01:52-01:55].\n\n3. **Mouthpiece Placement**: Place your lips around the mouthpiece of the spacer, ensuring that your teeth are behind the tabs and your tongue does not block the opening [Video 3: Zs8Fs5HaJHs, Time: 02:35-02:39].\n\n4. **Administering the Dose**: Press down on the inhaler once to release the medication into the spacer. Immediately take a slow, deep breath in. It\u2019s important that you do this without hearing a whistling sound, as that indicates you are inhaling too quickly [Video 2: ma_cmlU9DxU, Time: 01:52-01:55].\n\n5. **Breath Holding**",

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test.

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

      "answer": "To effectively treat AC joint pain, follow these steps highlighted in the videos:\n\n1. **Initial Assessment**: Begin by assessing your shoulder's range of motion and pain levels. You can do this by turning your arm out slightly and pulling it with the other hand to see if it causes pain, which may indicate an issue with the AC joint or other structures around the shoulder [Video 2: 04:50-04:52].\n\n2. **Physical Therapy Exercise**: The most effective treatment involves specific exercises. One recommended exercise is to perform gentle stretches and strengthening movements that target the muscles around the AC joint. This can help alleviate pain and improve function. Bob Schrupp emphasizes that there is a \"single best treatment\" for AC joint pain, which likely involves targeted physical therapy techniques [Video 1].\n\n3. **Safety Considerations**: Always ensure that any exercise or treatment does not exacerbate your pain. If you experience significant discomfort during any movement, it is crucial to stop and consult with a healthcare professional.\n\nBy following these steps and consulting with a physical therapist, you can effectively manage and treat AC joint pain.",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus.

          "text": "The main diagnostic test for CPD is called Spirometry. Spirometry is a lung-faction test that assesses how much air goes in and out of your lungs and how fast it does so. You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Ensure your neck is relaxed and your shoulders are down.\n\n2. **Neck Movement**: Gently tilt your head to one side, bringing your ear toward your shoulder. This action can help identify if the pain radiates down your arm, which is indicative of nerve involvement.\n\n3. **Compression**: Apply gentle pressure on the top of your head with your hands, pushing downward. This compression can mimic the foraminal compression that occurs when a nerve root is pinched in the neck, potentially causing pain that radiates into the shoulder area [Video 1: 02:29-02:34].\n\n4. **Observation**: Pay attention to any shooting pain or discomfort that travels from your neck into your shoulder. This symptom is a key indicator of radiculopathy [Video 2: 01:30-01:35].\n\n5. **Safety Note**: If you experience severe pain or discomfort during this test, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. Self-diagnosis should not replace professional medical evaluation. \n\nThis method can help you assess if your",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

So first thing we need to know, what's actually causing your shoulder problems, then we can help it, there's a few things we can do for you to help, there's a few bits, can do as well to help. There will be videos coming out, you can do as well, so stay tuned. Good luck with this. Thank you. Bye for now. Bye-bye.",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

      "answer": "To self-diagnose shoulder pain potentially caused by the brachial plexus using the Roos test, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit or stand comfortably. Raise both arms to shoulder height, bending your elbows at 90 degrees, and open and close your hands rapidly. This position helps to assess the function of the brachial plexus.\n\n2. **Duration**: Maintain this position for about 3 minutes. This duration is crucial as it allows for the assessment of any symptoms that may arise over time.\n\n3. **Observation of Symptoms**: Pay attention to any signs of pain, numbness, or tingling in your shoulders, arms, or hands during the test. These symptoms may indicate compression of the brachial plexus, which runs from the neck into the shoulder and can be affected by various structures, including muscles or the clavicle [Video 1: 02:29-02:34].\n\n4. **Safety Note**: If you experience significant pain or discomfort during the test, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. Self-diagnosis is not a substitute for professional medical evaluation, especially if symptoms persist [Video 1: 01:30-01:35].\n\n",

So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So first thing we need to know, what's actually causing your shoulder problems, then we can help it, there's a few things we can do for you to help, there's a few bits, can do as well to help. There will be videos coming out, you can do as well, so stay tuned. Good luck with this. Thank you. Bye for now. Bye-bye.",

So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

Common indicators of a rotator cuff tear include pain during overhead activities, weakness in the shoulder, and difficulty lifting the arm. A tear in one of the rotator cuff muscles is a frequent cause of shoulder problems [Video 1: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time: 03:38-03:43].\n\n2. **Perform a Self-Test**: You can conduct a simple test to assess the function of the subscapularis muscle, one of the rotator cuff muscles. This muscle is crucial for internal rotation of the shoulder [Video 2: 0CD3mYjPXxk, Time: 00:41-00:45]. \n\n3. **Check for Compression Issues**: Be aware that shoulder pain can also stem from compression of the brachial plexus or other structures. If you suspect this, you may need to assess for any numbness or tingling in your arm, which could indicate nerve involvement [Video 3: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time:",

If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on top of your shoulder. So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

So when your shoulder decreases its space and the tendon becomes stuck essentially. Now the test you can do for that on the right side is literally put your right hand on your left shoulder and then raise your arm up.

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one.

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Ensure you are in a comfortable standing or sitting position where you can maintain balance and stability.\n\n2. **Performing the Test**: With your fingers interlocked, pull your hands apart as hard as you can. This action engages the muscles and structures around the AC joint.\n\n3. **Observing Symptoms**: Pay attention to any discomfort or pain at the top of your shoulder during the test. If you notice a prominent bump or \"egg\" formation at the top of your shoulder, this may indicate an issue with the AC joint [Video 1: 05:32-05:36].\n\n4. **Interpreting Results**: If you experience pain or observe swelling, it suggests a potential problem with the AC joint. It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and treatment options.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience severe pain or discomfort during the test, stop immediately and seek medical advice. Self-diagnosis should not replace professional medical evaluation [Video 1: 04:50-04:52].",

This is so then you've most likely got an impingement in the shoulder itself or you can do the drop arm test where the arm is, you lift the arm up using the other hand or the way up and you bring it down and the drop arm test means you get to a stage where it gets really sore and you actually can't keep it up, you can't keep the arm up itself, we need to go, oh like that, you have this painful arc, that's a positive sign as well for an arrangement. So first thing we need to know, what's actually causing your shoulder problems, then we can help it, there's a few things we can do for you to help, there's a few bits, can do as well to help. There will be videos coming out, you can do as well, so stay tuned. Good luck with this. Thank you. Bye for now. Bye-bye.",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on top of your shoulder. So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

Then, slowly raise your arm up. If you experience pain during this movement, it may indicate shoulder impingement. This test helps assess the range of motion and pain associated with the shoulder joint [Video 1: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time: 06:17-06:20].\n\n2. **Drop Arm Test**: For this test, lift your arm up using your other hand and then let it drop down. Pay attention to any pain or discomfort as your arm descends. If you notice significant soreness or difficulty controlling the arm's descent, this could also suggest impingement [Video 1: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time: 06:17-06:20].\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience severe pain during these tests or if the pain persists, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and appropriate treatment. Self-diagnosis should not replace professional medical advice.",

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

What often is gravity is pulling fluid from everywhere in your body and it opens settles in your calf and ankles and feet. So we want to get it, the thing is, if you want to get rid of fluid, it's not going to go out your toes. It's got to go back up into your trunk where it gets processed and then it gets expelled from the body. In other words, your urinate or pee it out. Right, to be graphing. So we got to get the fluid back up into this area. So that's why it works really well if you can take like a leg wedge, we often recommend this for a back pain too. Or if you just take some pillows and put them on and you can get your feet up higher than your heart if you're possible. But that's doing a pretty good job.",

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

Usually what I'll tell people is we'll use the swimmers as a way to get to the next exercise. A lot of times this is a little more aggressive but it's my personal favorite way to straighten the entire spine. Last exercise that I want to demonstrate for you today is a superman exercise. You're going to be down here understanding once the end arm is extended over your head. Now what we're going to do is lift our arms and chest up off of the floor. Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees",

Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic.

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

What is sciatic and well-explained or numbness or can you leave them run down the back your leg? Most of the time caused by some problem of your your core back. If we can teach you the right strengthening and stabilization exercises to help minimize some of that problem, you're going to feel a lot better. That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad. Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or as a review, when you breathe in, your abdomen is actually expanding. And that opens up the diaphragm. So when Brad breathes in, you can see how it is expanding when he breathes out, it actually goes down. That's the opposite of what people quite often think. A lot of times they think, but breathing my chest should go out, but it's actually you want your diaphragm to go out. So if I have quick breaths, and then we can go on and start the exercises. So the first one, just to kind of get a little movement for the abdomen here, where actually just going to do kind of flexing forward here for five times.

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

And the nurse are coming out from your spinal cord and going from the spinal cord into your arms and into your legs. And in this area they wrap around the trunk. Sure, they wrap around the trunk.

But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad. Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or as a review, when you breathe in, your abdomen is actually expanding. And that opens up the diaphragm. So when Brad breathes in, you can see how it is expanding when he breathes out, it actually goes down. That's the opposite of what people quite often think. A lot of times they think, but breathing my chest should go out, but it's actually you want your diaphragm to go out. So if I have quick breaths, and then we can go on and start the exercises. So the first one, just to kind of get a little movement for the abdomen here, where actually just going to do kind of flexing forward here for five times.

And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is",

So we want to get it, the thing is, if you want to get rid of fluid, it's not going to go out your toes. It's got to go back up into your trunk where it gets processed and then it gets expelled from the body. In other words, your urinate or pee it out. Right, to be graphing. So we got to get the fluid back up into this area. So that's why it works really well if you can take like a leg wedge, we often recommend this for a back pain too. Or if you just take some pillows and put them on and you can get your feet up higher than your heart if you're possible. But that's doing a pretty good job.",

Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

      "answer": "To perform trunk flexes for leg edema, you should flex forward at the waist. This exercise is intended to promote abdominal movement and can help with fluid circulation, which may alleviate edema in the legs. Specifically, you should aim to perform this flexing motion 10 to 15 times in a session. It's important to ensure that your diaphragm is engaged during the exercise, as this can enhance respiratory function and overall effectiveness of the movement [Video 1: vgW6ZD_QwwQ, Time: 03:17-03:19].\n\nIn summary, trunk flexes involve bending forward at the waist while maintaining proper breathing techniques. This exercise should be repeated multiple times to encourage movement and may assist in managing leg edema by promoting better circulation. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise regimen, especially if you have underlying health conditions.",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those.

Doctor of physical therapy, tone and time, and in this video I want to share with you five of the best core strengthening exercises for your sciatic nerve pain. What is sciatic and well-explained or numbness or can you leave them run down the back your leg? Most of the time caused by some problem of your your core back. If we can teach you the right strengthening and stabilization exercises to help minimize some of that problem, you're going to feel a lot better. That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

So we could say, today, Joe, you did 80%. Next week, you do 95%. So it gives you that concrete evidence. Essentially, what it's going to do is it's going to record how long it takes you to touch the number that they say. 46, four, two. And I write, and it gives you that nice, nice auditory feedback. So that one was definitely a lot quicker. Okay, the first one was 38, the second one, I mean, excuse me, the first one was 85, the second one was 38.

One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full",

So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first.

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe,",

One of the best ways to strengthen your lower back muscles is to actually train them with your hips. One of my favorite ways to do that at home is with some bridges. Let's go ahead and get started, lay down on your back with both of your knees bent. What I'm going to do now is contract your glutes, squeeze your butt. together and then use that contraction to lift your hips off floor again the emphasis is right here in the butt muscles in those blue muscles we're going to hold this for about three to five seconds and then we're going to come right back now keep in mind the higher you go the more chance that it has to be irritating to your lower back go up as high as you can pay for you try to keep this in as pain free rate as you can I like to tell people we're going to shoot for about 10 to 20 repetitions and then we're going to repeat that through times.

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

So we could say, today, Joe, you did 80%. Next week, you do 95%. So it gives you that concrete evidence. Essentially, what it's going to do is it's going to record how long it takes you to touch the number that they say. 46, four, two. And I write, and it gives you that nice, nice auditory feedback. So that one was definitely a lot quicker. Okay, the first one was 38, the second one, I mean, excuse me, the first one was 85, the second one was 38. So let's definitely improve and give it another try. Okay. 25. 59. 39.",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

From there what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much as we can, really put the back into a backwards extension just like this, and then from there I'm going to plant my feet on the floor and then lift my butt up, kind of like creating a bridge like exercise. This time what's going to happen is that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the can into the floor, and it really intensifies the stretch. It feels really, really good for me. And if that joint is locked up, this might get it too self-release. but you can hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds. If it feels good, hold it for longer. You can hold it upwards towards the minute, but we need to breathe out just lower your butt down like this. And then repeat it about three to five times. From there, you can just switch over different spots as needed. If it still feels like it does not watch release, what we can do from there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement.

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities.

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe,",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of",

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot.

Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than",

You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from.

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

          "text": "First degree burns are very common. Unlike second or third degree burns, first degree burns only involve the top layer of the skin. People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

          "text": "muscles. These are called your trapezius muscles. Now there's three parts to these muscles and you need to know about all of them to properly address this problem. There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll them forward so they're really good at creating neck pain. The middle traps actually squeeze the shoulder blades together. And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of",

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

What is sciatic and well-explained or numbness or can you leave them run down the back your leg? Most of the time caused by some problem of your your core back. If we can teach you the right strengthening and stabilization exercises to help minimize some of that problem, you're going to feel a lot better. That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

So it actually stops that large inward curve in you like that. So lying down in this position. Coming down, now your forehead needs to be in contact with the ground, your arms are down and your palm are facing downwards. So I mean that position, now your head stays in contact with the ground during the whole exercise. The first exercise is to pull the shoulders away from the ears. Now can you try that at home or wherever you are? Head down, pull the shoulders away from your ears and then actually start to activate those lower trapezius muscles I was showing you on the diagram for earlier. Now second step is pull your shoulders away from your ears, squeeze your shoulders together and lift your hands just off the ground and now lower them down slowly and relax. Now you already know if you're doing this thing correctly. If you tend to be tight through upper traps, this is what you'll do. You'll lift and you'll pull up that way and",

Please check out my three exercises for acute lower back pain. The video will definitely help you get moving again and also prevent lower back pain. I still do those exercises on the daily. Now, if you do have flat feet, there could be a chance that you do have both legs, not knees, where your knees move inwards and you might want to do some exercises to prevent that or improve that, so you don't get the general change and promote flat feet. Please check out my both leg video. The video will definitely help you out.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll them forward so they're really good at creating neck pain. The middle traps actually squeeze the shoulder blades together. And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym",

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were?

Usually what I'll tell people is we'll use the swimmers as a way to get to the next exercise. A lot of times this is a little more aggressive but it's my personal favorite way to straighten the entire spine. Last exercise that I want to demonstrate for you today is a superman exercise. You're going to be down here understanding once the end arm is extended over your head. Now what we're going to do is lift our arms and chest up off of the floor. Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

This position provides a stable base for the exercise.\n\n2. **Movement**: Slowly extend your right arm forward while simultaneously extending your left leg back. Keep your back straight and avoid sagging or arching your spine. This movement should be controlled to maintain stability in your lower back.\n\n3. **Hold**: Aim to hold this position for a few seconds, focusing on engaging your core muscles to support your lower back.\n\n4. **Return**: Gently return to the starting position and switch sides, extending your left arm and right leg.\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10 to 20 repetitions on each side, and repeat the set three times for optimal results [Video 2: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 02:21-02:26].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that the exercise is performed in a pain-free range of motion. If you experience discomfort, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.",

As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot.

Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower",

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back.

From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

Ensure that your hip remains parallel to the floor throughout the exercise to maximize engagement of the lateral muscles [Video 1: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 03:33-03:35].\n\n3. **Leg Position**: For added intensity, extend the top leg straight out and hold it in the air. This modification increases the challenge on the lateral hip muscles [Video 3: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 04:11-04:14].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10 to 20 repetitions on each side, and repeat the set three times for optimal results [Video 2: CWRWeoaqi8k, Time: 02:21-02:26].\n\n**Safety Considerations**: Ensure that your body forms",

One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full",

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of",

Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower",

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back.

Usually what I'll tell people is we'll use the swimmers as a way to get to the next exercise. A lot of times this is a little more aggressive but it's my personal favorite way to straighten the entire spine. Last exercise that I want to demonstrate for you today is a superman exercise. You're going to be down here understanding once the end arm is extended over your head. Now what we're going to do is lift our arms and chest up off of the floor. Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower",

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

Usually what I'll tell people is we'll use the swimmers as a way to get to the next exercise. A lot of times this is a little more aggressive but it's my personal favorite way to straighten the entire spine. Last exercise that I want to demonstrate for you today is a superman exercise. You're going to be down here understanding once the end arm is extended over your head. Now what we're going to do is lift our arms and chest up off of the floor. Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below.

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Because we have the most famous physical therapists on the internet. In our opinion, of course. Today we're going to talk about neck pain, pinch nerve. How do you know if you're doing the right neck exercises or stretches? Sure. This is very important because if you're doing the wrong one, it can make it worse. Absolutely. and such on the wrong direction quick. So the common causes of a pinch nerve in the neck are you could have a disc problem. You could have degeneration of the bones and to the point where they make the whole smaller where the nerves come out, or you could have thoracic outlets in them. That's where you get impenething between the collar bone and the first rib, right? So, and you could also just have compression of muscles. And in the neck, so there's more, but there's more. Yeah, I don't need the bore, that's right. So neck pain can vary in location intensity. It depends on your diagnosis, your age, and your posture. But the common locations are, and I guess we got kind of, we met them out. We met them out. This is for a pinch nerve, but it's very common to have neck pain, of course, up in the neck itself. But then you can also, Brad, do you want to show off some other stuff? Sure. So a lot",

And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome.

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees come up off of the floor. And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

It causes your feet to roll inwards and create a typical portion where you need bow in. And that can cause stress and strain in your hips and lower back as well. It shifts your weight into other structures such as ligaments, joints, and muscles have compensate and that can cause pain and also promote arthritis or degenerate change. A lot of people will self-dognose themselves for fasciitis which is a irritation of the connective tissue under their foot and I'm going to show you in this video some short-term things you can do to prevent this pain or improve this pain.

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do.

This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility.

The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from.

So here is what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch, and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving. This one is best done at the edge of a bed, but you can also do this one on the floor. What I'm going to do is start with one leg straight. Usually the leg that's closest towards the edge of the bed. And then the other side, what I'm going to do is bend the knee and then keep the foot flat. I'm just going to press into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press down for stable anchor point. Let's take the hand that's closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge. Just for a little bit more support. What I'm going to do from there is bend the other sides arm, so in this case, I'm going to take my right elbow and I'm going to place it on the inside of my right knee. From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

Ensure that your foot is positioned correctly, avoiding having the ball too far forward [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 02:02-02:08].\n\n2. **Foot Movement**: Roll your ankles outward and your heels inward. This positioning helps to engage the correct muscles and stabilize your foot [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 02:02-02:08].\n\n3. **Calf Raise Execution**: Push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift your heels up. While doing this, visualize squeezing your calf muscles and creating an arch under your foot simultaneously. This helps strengthen the muscles that support your arches [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 02:02-02:08].\n\n4. **Repetitions and Sets**: Perform 15 to 20 repetitions for 3 to 4 sets. This frequency can help build strength and reduce foot pain over time [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw",

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

You guys are looking for more information on how to resolve putting any conditions. I created a little mini guide for you on the corner here, pretty straight into the point. I'm in a very cheap, I made it so that basically it's all the stuff that you were looking for on YouTube, but we're really frustrated and you couldn't find it, because it's way too much damn sit on YouTube. So you're going to find it all right there. I laid it all out for you and I tried to break it down in this fashion, so not all the videos are They're just people that I've found that have done very good demonstrations such as this and you're gonna get a lot from it So if you like this share with friend, I'll see you guys next week",

It causes your feet to roll inwards and create a typical portion where you need bow in. And that can cause stress and strain in your hips and lower back as well. It shifts your weight into other structures such as ligaments, joints, and muscles have compensate and that can cause pain and also promote arthritis or degenerate change. A lot of people will self-dognose themselves for fasciitis which is a irritation of the connective tissue under their foot and I'm going to show you in this video some short-term things you can do to prevent this pain or improve this pain. I hope these exercises and stretches help you as much as they helped me and my patients. Kind of raises with a ball. Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward",

The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here I'm using a large bag of rice. You can use a large bag of potatoes if you like. In this technique try to be relaxed as possible and feel the body weight pressing evenly on the ball of your feet and the heel at no point should you feel your heel lift off the floor. If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from.

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

It causes your feet to roll inwards and create a typical portion where you need bow in. And that can cause stress and strain in your hips and lower back as well. It shifts your weight into other structures such as ligaments, joints, and muscles have compensate and that can cause pain and also promote arthritis or degenerate change. A lot of people will self-dognose themselves for fasciitis which is a irritation of the connective tissue under their foot and I'm going to show you in this video some short-term things you can do to prevent this pain or improve this pain. I hope these exercises and stretches help you as much as they helped me and my patients. Kind of raises with a ball. Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward",

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

This weight will provide resistance during the exercise [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 03:09-03:17].\n\n2. **Position Your Feet**: Ensure your feet are flat on the ground. Your knees should be positioned forward, allowing for a full range of motion.\n\n3. **Perform the Exercise**: Drive your knees forward as much as possible while keeping your feet flat. This motion engages the muscles in your lower legs and helps improve dorsiflexion, which is crucial for reducing foot pain and addressing conditions like flat feet [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 03:09-03:17].\n\n4. **Repetitions and Sets**: Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions, completing 3 to 4 sets.

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do.

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

It shifts your weight into other structures such as ligaments, joints, and muscles have compensate and that can cause pain and also promote arthritis or degenerate change.

My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So for demonstrated purposes, I will be using my can of soup. So if you are using the soup can, just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like this and then roll it up and you kind of have a homemade foam roller. So there I'm just going to position it right on the upper back. So I just go",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were?

Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

What you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little bit differently. So experiment with different angles. Go all the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the left. If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

      "answer": "To perform a foot self-release exercise using a lacrosse ball or massage ball, start by positioning the ball under the arch of your foot. Gently roll your foot over the ball, applying pressure to areas that feel tight or sore. This technique helps to alleviate tension and improve flexibility in the foot muscles. \n\nWhile rolling, focus on pushing the balls of your feet into the ground to lift your heels, similar to a calf raise. This action engages the calf muscles and helps to create an arch under your foot, which is beneficial for overall foot health. Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions and perform 3 to 4 sets to maximize the benefits of the exercise [Video 2: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 02:02-02:08]. \n\nIn summary, using a lacrosse or massage ball for self-release involves rolling the foot over the ball while engaging the calf muscles to promote strength and flexibility. This exercise can be particularly helpful for individuals with flat feet or those experiencing foot discomfort [Video 3: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 00:44-00:49].",

And then we have our tubes, we have alcohol pads, the bandit, and we have the gloss pad to take care of the patient after we're done drawing blood. So the first thing you're going to do is put on a turning kit, So we have to look for a vein, and the turning kit is going to go, this is going to increase to the elbow, it's going to go about three to four inches above it, and once you put time to turn it, show our exhibition if it's too tight, and then that's the patient to pop their fist a couple times, and she's going to pop it, we'll pop it in is where she's going to just feel for a vein, and the vein will bounce back on her fingers that sure know that's a good thing. So you never go by site, you always go by touch to feel for a vein. And he has a pretty good vein right in the middle and this is the vein that we this is the first vein that we use in full army. And then just choice two and three. Once he has popated, she's going to clean the area and there is a proper way of cleaning the area which you're going to do is you're going to start from",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Don't worry too much about the red dots, it's just blood kind of coming to the surface because it is a suction cup, but we're not trying to pull blood or anything like that or do any acupuncture, okay. So these are just simple things you can do with a suction cup. You can get them for like five bucks on Amazon, you get like a whole set. And you'd be surprised you do this pretty frequently throughout the day, like five times or so. And all of a sudden the stuff starts to dissipate and you wonder, why the heck did the suction cup or skin pulling work with this thing, right? It's just a way to desense ties the area.

You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations. So that's really how you kind of lock these feelings in and make it feel better for the long haul. So if you guys like this, give me a thumbs up in this video and share it with a friend who's",

Now if you do have a little back pain and there could be a chance that you're getting it from flat feet or even both legs and it's stopping you from getting out of bed or doing daily tasks. Please check out my three exercises for acute lower back pain. The video will definitely help you get moving again and also prevent lower back pain. I still do those exercises on the daily. Now, if you do have flat feet, there could be a chance that you do have both legs, not knees, where your knees move inwards and you might want to do some exercises to prevent that or improve that, so you don't get the general change and promote flat feet. Please check out my both leg video. The video will definitely help you out.

It causes your feet to roll inwards and create a typical portion where you need bow in. And that can cause stress and strain in your hips and lower back as well. It shifts your weight into other structures such as ligaments, joints, and muscles have compensate and that can cause pain and also promote arthritis or degenerate change. A lot of people will self-dognose themselves for fasciitis which is a irritation of the connective tissue under their foot and I'm going to show you in this video some short-term things you can do to prevent this pain or improve this pain. I hope these exercises and stretches help you as much as they helped me and my patients. Kind of raises with a ball. Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet.

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up.

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down. Come high as high as you",

The video demonstrates these exercises specifically aimed at addressing the neck hump, often caused by prolonged poor posture, such as looking at phones or tablets [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 00:53-00:57].\n\nOne recommended exercise is the \"Y\" position, where you extend your arms above your head in a Y shape while lying face down. This helps to engage the upper back muscles and counteract forward head posture. Another is the \"W\" position, where you bend your elbows and pull them down towards your sides, which strengthens the muscles that support proper spinal alignment. \n\nIncorporating these YWTL exercises into your routine can help alleviate the neck hump by promoting better posture and reducing muscle tension in the neck and upper back. Regular practice can lead to significant improvements in your posture and overall spinal health [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 03:54-03:58].",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day.

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down.

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck.

Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back.

So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as well. So that's nice and straight. Eyes level, eyes forward, chin up. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and back. The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder",

      "answer": "A simple and effective exercise to improve posture and reduce a neck hump, also known as dowager's hump, is the \"Y-W-T-L\" exercise. This exercise involves positioning your arms in different formations to strengthen the muscles that support proper posture. Specifically, you start with your arms back and hold this position for about 30 seconds. Then, transition to an \"L\" position by keeping your elbows at your sides and extending your arms outwards, again holding for approximately 30 seconds. This exercise targets the upper back and shoulder muscles, which are crucial for counteracting the effects of poor posture often caused by prolonged phone or tablet use [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 00:53-00:57; Video 2: T43753AfaKY, Time: 02:33-02:35].\n\nIn summary, incorporating the Y-W-T-L exercise into your routine can significantly help in alleviating the neck hump by strengthening the relevant muscle groups, thereby promoting better posture. Regular practice of this exercise can lead to long-term improvements in spinal alignment and overall neck health.",

          "text": "In this video, I'm going to demonstrate some really simple but yet highly effective exercises to get rid of your dowager's hump or your neck hump once and for all. So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up.

If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down. Come high as high as you",

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat.

Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back.

      "answer": "A simple exercise using a wall to improve posture and reduce the neck hump involves performing the \"Y-W-T-L\" exercise. This exercise focuses on strengthening the upper back and improving shoulder alignment, which can counteract the effects of prolonged poor posture often associated with neck humps.\n\nTo perform the exercise, stand against a wall with your arms positioned in a \"Y\" shape, then transition to a \"W\" position by bending your elbows and pulling them down to your sides. Next, extend your arms out to form a \"T\" shape, and finally, bring your arms down to an \"L\" position with elbows at your sides. Hold each position for about 30 seconds, ensuring you engage your back muscles throughout the movements [Video 2: T43753AfaKY, Time: 02:33-02:35].\n\nThis exercise is effective for addressing the neck hump by promoting better posture and strengthening the muscles that support the cervical spine. Regular practice can lead to significant improvements in posture and a reduction in the appearance of the neck hump [Video 1].",

          "text": "your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button down below and you can always find me at askdoctorjo.com. So we're going to start off with some stretches and then we'll move into the exercises towards the end. So the first stretch is an upper trap stretch. A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades.

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using an upper trap stretch, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by sitting or standing up straight. Ensure your shoulders are relaxed and not hunched.\n\n2. **Shoulder Blade Stabilization**: While performing the stretch, it can be beneficial to hold your shoulder down. This helps to stabilize the shoulder blade, enhancing the effectiveness of the stretch [Video 1: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 03:21-03:25].\n\n3. **Neck Position**: Instead of bringing your head down or tilting it to the side, keep your head in a neutral position. This is crucial as it ensures that you are targeting the upper trapezius muscle correctly without straining other areas [Video 1].\n\n4. **Gentle Stretch**: Gently tilt your head to one side, aiming to bring your ear towards your shoulder. Hold this position for a few seconds, feeling the stretch along the side of your neck.\n\n5. **Repetition**: Repeat the stretch on the other side. Aim for 2-3 repetitions on each side.\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid forcing the stretch or causing pain. If you experience discomfort, stop the",

So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching the top of my ear. Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades. And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Bye Okay, so a quick and the neck is usually a muscular thing and it typically happens in one or two ways. One is kind of a neck strain that you get from maybe lifting something too heavy or doing an exercise where you really kind of strain into your neck. And the second way is when you have your head in a position and it can be either way where the pain in the neck can come from this part of the side of the neck where the muscles have been compressed in or too short or it can be from this side where the muscles are stretched in too long. It's usually this side, I find, in most of my patients. So you will also feel a lot of times with neck pain. You also feel it kind of going down into the shoulder blade. So you can kind of see here this muscle here, the levator scape kind of comes off the vertebrae and comes down out to the shoulder blade. So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button down below and you can always find me at askdoctorjo.com. So we're going to start off with some stretches and then we'll move into the exercises towards the end. So the first stretch is an upper trap stretch. A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck.

Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the",

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using chin tucks, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by sitting or standing with your back straight and shoulders relaxed. Ensure your head is in a neutral position, aligned with your spine.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck Execution**: Gently pull your chin straight back towards your throat. This movement should feel like you are creating a double chin, but avoid tilting your head up or down. Hold this position for a few seconds.\n\n3. **Repetition**: Repeat the chin tuck exercise for 10-15 repetitions. This helps strengthen the neck muscles and improve posture, which can alleviate pain and reduce the appearance of a neck hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 09:47-09:50].\n\n4. **Use of Resistance**: For enhanced results, you can incorporate a resistance band (taraband) during the exercise. This will provide additional strength training to the neck muscles, promoting quicker improvements [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 08:19-08:22].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure you perform the exercise slowly and avoid any sudden movements that could exacerbate pain.

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all.

Bye Okay, so a quick and the neck is usually a muscular thing and it typically happens in one or two ways. One is kind of a neck strain that you get from maybe lifting something too heavy or doing an exercise where you really kind of strain into your neck. And the second way is when you have your head in a position and it can be either way where the pain in the neck can come from this part of the side of the neck where the muscles have been compressed in or too short or it can be from this side where the muscles are stretched in too long. It's usually this side, I find, in most of my patients. So you will also feel a lot of times with neck pain. You also feel it kind of going down into the shoulder blade. So you can kind of see here this muscle here, the levator scape kind of comes off the vertebrae and comes down out to the shoulder blade. So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should",

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

Ensure your head is aligned with your spine.\n\n2. **Preparation**: Gently place your right hand on the right side of your head. This will help stabilize your head during the exercise.\n\n3. **Isometric Action**: While keeping your head upright, apply gentle pressure with your right hand against your head, resisting the urge to tilt your head to the right. Hold this position for about 5-10 seconds. This is the isometric part of the exercise, which helps strengthen the neck muscles without moving them.\n\n4. **Switch Sides**: Repeat the same process on the left side by placing your left hand on the left side of your head and applying gentle pressure while resisting the tilt.\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Perform 2-3 repetitions on each side. This exercise can help reset your posture and alleviate tension in the neck muscles, promoting an upright position [Video 1: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 07:47-07:50].\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid excessive force when applying pressure, and ensure you",

We've lowered the patient down to the floor carefully using good ergonomics ourselves, protecting the patient's head and protecting them from trauma from them crashing to the floor. If we've not already called 911 or called the code, now is the time to do so. Once they're on the floor, we go straight into our chest compressions. We may notice that we have actually put on gloves because I know I'm going to be trying to pull an object out of the mouth if I've actually gotten one up and into the mouth. So it's good time to put your gloves on if you haven't already and have a CPR shield available and ready to use with a one-way valve. Keep in note here that when we do these chest thross or chest compressions, we're going to be going to a depth of 2 to 2.4 inches deep and we're going to do it at a rate between 100 and 120 times per minute. We're going to give our first 30 chance compressions, elbows locked, leaning over the victims chest, using our upper body weight to do the chest compression. One in, two in, three in, four in, five in, six in, seven in, eight, nine in, ten, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. After my 30 chance compressions, I head to chin lift, I open up the mouth.

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So, use my fingers and any part never use the fingernails, okay? Relax your shoulders, breathe out, and then clasherly apply firm pressure. And then, who's your fingers up to the top of your head? And, come out, again, apply firm pressure. with your fingers and slide them. The top of your head, third one, apply front pressure and raise that relax your shoulders and slide them to the top of your head. Let's do the side and back of your head, right right here. from pushing the scalp and gradually oh, slide them up to the top. Okay, and don't hold your breath, that's also important. Be sound while you are moving your fingers up. And that's one, and turn back. Oh, no way, uh, but, woo! Feel straight. using that mini part of your middle fingers, firmly push down the top of your head. Show the glaze down, open your chest, breathe out, and feel it. Feel the pressure and come out. How do you feel? Do you feel more awake? Do you feel more blood circulation on the neck, face and a scuff? Try it, whatever you need a little bit",

So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on",

If they are unresponsive and not breathing normally, begin chest compressions. Position yourself beside the patient, place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest, and the other hand on top, interlocking your fingers. Keep your arms straight and use your body weight to compress the chest downwards at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute, allowing full chest recoil between compressions.\n\nContinue this process until emergency services arrive or the patient shows signs of life.

After my 30 chance compressions, I head to chin lift, I open up the mouth. I look in the oral cavity to see if I've gotten anything up out of the airway. I don't see anything so I'm not going to do a blind finger sweep. I cover their nose and mouth with my CPR shield and I attempt to rescue breath. I try the breath, nothing goes in, no chest rise and fall. I reposition their head and neck and try again. No breath goes in, no chest rise and fall. So I continue with another 30 compressions, if the same depth at the same rate. After these 30 compressions, I go back, I look in the mouth, but this time I see something. So I reach in, I pull the object out, and I attempt a rescue breath. Let's see if we're successful. First breath goes in, second breath goes in. If the patient is not breathing normally at this point, not responsive, I go straight into my next 30 compressions. If the patient remains unresponsive, not breathing normally, I'm going to do 30 compressions followed by two rescue breaths, and I'm going to keep doing this 30 compressions to two rescue breaths until EMS arrives, help arrives, and AED arrives, or the victim becomes responsive and begins breathing normally",

Just rain going out those ribs, pushing the ribs out and up, arching up and over with some big breaths. Now let's get a little rhythm, come back to center, big breath into one side. Breathing out, coming back up, breathing into the other side. It feels good, big breath in. Now let's do some four seven eight breathing.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

You can go cross-legged on the ground also. Let's start with some breathing through your nose, with some massage on either side of your nose. Do some circular motions here. You know, this nose needs to be open. Sometimes I'll have people do breathing exercise just holding open like that. Let's get them open, just by doing some massage, do some deep massage, get a little vigorous with it. Today, we are going to do 478 breathing. You're going to do four seconds in, seven second, hold, and eight second out. 478 breathing. It's a good one. It helps balance out the nervous system kind of defrazzly. Give you a clear palate. So your nervous system is ready to function the way it needs to function. Go out a little bit, let's get that face. anything connected to the nose, let's get it open, good. Okay, now let's open the lungs a little bit in the back, right? 360 is 360 degree all the way around. So we're gonna take the hands like this, push the palms together, curl forward, take a big breath in through the back body, feel it tighten up, breathing out, Pushing the hands even harder together good now we're going to come back we're in a class that the hands together like this take a big breath in.

Or if you just take some pillows and put them on and you can get your feet up higher than your heart if you're possible. But that's doing a pretty good job. But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad. Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or as a review, when you breathe in, your abdomen is actually expanding. And that opens up the diaphragm. So when Brad breathes in, you can see how it is expanding when he breathes out, it actually goes down. That's the opposite of what people quite often think. A lot of times they think, but breathing my chest should go out, but it's actually you want your diaphragm to go out. So if I have quick breaths, and then we can go on and start the exercises. So the first one, just to kind of get a little movement for the abdomen here, where actually just going to do kind of flexing forward here for five times. I'm sorry, these are all 10 to 15 times actually. Let's stick",

If unresponsive, call for emergency help.\n\n3. **Position the Victim**: Lay the victim flat on their back on a firm surface.\n\n4. **Open the Airway**: Use the chin lift maneuver. Place one hand on the forehead and two fingers under the chin to tilt the head back gently, opening the airway [Video 1: oIuGLGlQ2gg, Time: 01:56-01:58].\n\n5. **Check for Obstructions**: Look into the mouth to see if there are any obstructions that need to be removed.\n\n6. **Deliver Rescue Breaths**: Pinch the victim's nose shut, take a deep breath, seal your lips around their mouth, and give two breaths, each lasting about one second. Ensure the chest rises visibly with each breath.\n\n7. **Continue CPR**: After two rescue breaths, continue with chest compressions if needed, following the appropriate ratio of compressions to",

We may notice that we have actually put on gloves because I know I'm going to be trying to pull an object out of the mouth if I've actually gotten one up and into the mouth. So it's good time to put your gloves on if you haven't already and have a CPR shield available and ready to use with a one-way valve. Keep in note here that when we do these chest thross or chest compressions, we're going to be going to a depth of 2 to 2.4 inches deep and we're going to do it at a rate between 100 and 120 times per minute. We're going to give our first 30 chance compressions, elbows locked, leaning over the victims chest, using our upper body weight to do the chest compression.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

You can go cross-legged on the ground also. Let's start with some breathing through your nose, with some massage on either side of your nose. Do some circular motions here. You know, this nose needs to be open. Sometimes I'll have people do breathing exercise just holding open like that. Let's get them open, just by doing some massage, do some deep massage, get a little vigorous with it. Today, we are going to do 478 breathing. You're going to do four seconds in, seven second, hold, and eight second out. 478 breathing. It's a good one. It helps balance out the nervous system kind of defrazzly. Give you a clear palate. So your nervous system is ready to function the way it needs to function. Go out a little bit, let's get that face. anything connected to the nose, let's get it open, good. Okay, now let's open the lungs a little bit in the back, right? 360 is 360 degree all the way around. So we're gonna take the hands like this, push the palms together, curl forward, take a big breath in through the back body, feel it tighten up, breathing out, Pushing the hands even harder together good now we're going to come back we're in a class that the hands together like this take a big breath in.

You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt.

And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can. And we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet.

You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus.

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area. So, use",

You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this while off and you'll see how easily it snaps off and goes into your tube.",

      "answer": "To open the nose through massage, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by either sitting down without back support or standing. You may also choose to sit cross-legged on the ground for comfort [Video 1: M6UBlnV1Cyk, Time: 00:49-00:51].\n\n2. **Breathing**: Begin with some deep breathing through your nose to prepare for the massage. This helps to relax the nasal passages and enhance the effectiveness of the massage.\n\n3. **Massage Technique**: Use your fingers to apply gentle pressure on either side of your nose. Perform circular motions with your fingertips, focusing on the areas around the nostrils and the bridge of the nose. This technique can help relieve congestion and promote better airflow [Video 1].\n\n4. **Duration**: Continue the massage for a few minutes, ensuring that you are not applying excessive pressure, which could cause discomfort. \n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always listen to your body; if you feel pain or discomfort, stop the massage. Avoid using sharp or hard objects for this massage to prevent injury.\n\nThis method can be beneficial for easing nasal congestion and promoting relaxation.",

You can go cross-legged on the ground also. Let's start with some breathing through your nose, with some massage on either side of your nose. Do some circular motions here. You know, this nose needs to be open. Sometimes I'll have people do breathing exercise just holding open like that. Let's get them open, just by doing some massage, do some deep massage, get a little vigorous with it. Today, we are going to do 478 breathing. You're going to do four seconds in, seven second, hold, and eight second out. 478 breathing. It's a good one. It helps balance out the nervous system kind of defrazzly. Give you a clear palate. So your nervous system is ready to function the way it needs to function. Go out a little bit, let's get that face. anything connected to the nose, let's get it open, good. Okay, now let's open the lungs a little bit in the back, right? 360 is 360 degree all the way around. So we're gonna take the hands like this, push the palms together, curl forward, take a big breath in through the back body, feel it tighten up, breathing out, Pushing the hands even harder together good now we're going to come back we're in a class that the hands together like this take a big breath in.

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

This will help stretch your chest and shoulders effectively [Video 3: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 02:38-02:42].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your eyes level and lean into the corner. This position helps to open up the chest area [Video 3].\n\n3. **Elbow Position**: For a more advanced technique, raise your elbows to shoulder level while keeping your forearms parallel to the ground. This adjustment increases the stretch across your chest and shoulders [Video 3].\n\n4. **Gentle Pressure**: Apply light pressure as you lean into the corner. Avoid forcing your body into the stretch; instead, focus on a gentle opening of the chest [Video 3].\n\n5. **Breathing**: While performing this massage, remember to breathe deeply through your nose. This will enhance relaxation and further open the lungs [Video 1: M6UBlnV1Cyk, Time: 00:49-00:51].\n\n**",

          "text": "Hi, I'm Sandy and this is Sarah. We're respiratory therapist here at the Nebraska Medical Center. We are here to demonstrate the use of the incentive sprometer. When used according to your physician instructions, this device will help you maintain and improve respiratory fitness. Normally, we take many deep breaths each hour, usually without being aware of it, they're spontaneous and automatic. When you're experiencing pain after chest or abdominal surgery, for example, breathing tends to become shallow, and deep breaths are suppressed and effort to minimize pain. In these instances, it's important that you try to resume your normal breathing pattern despite any discomfort you may feel. Taking deep breaths will help prevent the possibility of respiratory complications. So Sarah's going to exhale naturally, place the device in her mouth, and inhale, taking a nice big deep breath in. When you're inhaling, you want to make sure that this flow cup is maintained in the best flow range. The white piston moves up very slowly and then do a nice breath hold for five seconds and exhale. After your final breath hold, we encourage you to cough to clear any secretions that you may have. We look forward to being a part of your successful recovery here at the Nebraska Medical Center. Thank you so much for watching this video and I'll see you in the next video, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video and I'll see you in the next video and I'll see you in the next video",

Work a couple more, big breath in, stretch it up, and breathing out one more, big breath in, stretching it all the way up, up, up, up, up, good breathing out, good. Let's give yourself a nice bear hug, take your arms, give yourself the tightest hug, I love you, lean to the side and breathe into that side body. Just take a couple of breaths here. Ooh, feeling the stretch all the way to the outer hip. Tighten your abs at the bottom of the breath. Big breath in. Let's go to the other side. Big breath in. Just rain going out those ribs, pushing the ribs out and up, arching up and over with some big breaths. Now let's get a little rhythm, come back to center, big breath into one side. Breathing out, coming back up, breathing into the other side. It feels good, big breath in. Now let's do some four seven eight breathing. So place the tip of your tongue right behind the right of the gum line behind the top And you're going to keep in there the whole time, okay?

To focus a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y stretch.

One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core. We're talking about the elite muscles. We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full",

Let that tension out, the more you're relaxed, the more results that you're gonna get with this. From there, I'm just going to relax. Come back up, take a breather, and then repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, go down just a little bit more stretch into it, challenge those muscles to open up those joints.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

But also you can do these in the seated position. They're still gonna help. They just won't be quite as effective. Sure. So we got the seven exercises. Let's get started, Brad. Before we do quite often, you wanna do a little bit of deep diaphragmatic breathing which kind of clears the area here. And if you know how to do diaphragatic breathing or as a review, when you breathe in, your abdomen is actually expanding. And that opens up the diaphragm. So when Brad breathes in, you can see how it is expanding when he breathes out, it actually goes down. That's the opposite of what people quite often think. A lot of times they think, but breathing my chest should go out, but it's actually you want your diaphragm to go out. So if I have quick breaths, and then we can go on and start the exercises. So the first one, just to kind of get a little movement for the abdomen here, where actually just going to do kind of flexing forward here for five times.

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

Take a big breath in through your back, feeling your body tighten up. This helps engage your core and prepares you for the movement [Video 1: M6UBlnV1Cyk, Time: 02:00-02:02].\n\n3. **Lateral Raise Movement**: As you exhale, slowly raise your arms out to the sides until they are parallel to the ground. Ensure your elbows are slightly bent and your wrists are straight. \n\n4. **Breath Control**: While lowering your arms back to the starting position, take another deep breath in, and as you exhale, push your hands together again. This reinforces the breathing technique and helps maintain relaxation [Video 1: M6UBlnV1Cyk, Time: 02:00-02:02].\n\n5. **Repetition**: Repeat this sequence for several repetitions, focusing on your breath and maintaining a steady rhythm.\n\n",

You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there. And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release.

And then just wing the elbows down towards the floor. What this will do is it stretches the chest, opens the pack up just a little bit differently.

You can also do what our known as floor angels. So go down all the way right here. Lower the hands down towards, or I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor. And then from there I'm going to wing my elbows down as much as I can. and then just raise my arms overhead just like this.

You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So you want to go down as far as you're able to go, just letting gravity take it. From there what I do is wing my elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my head. This will create a passive stretch into the upper back, and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click, or crack. Again, that is just gas is being released from the joints. You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level.",

Good, now come up and just lean over to your left grab that outer knee and the hand comes on the head and just coming over to the side. Ooh feeling that inner thigh loving it doing things that your hips probably haven't done in a while. You're going to get up from this feeling pretty fantastic. Fantastic. Go ahead all the way over to the side, pulling it, pulling it, pulling it. And now we're going to, the next one we're going to dive in forward. Okay. I want your knee, I want your nose going right towards the middle of your shin, not over to the left or the right, right in the middle. And now we feel it in the glutes, we feel it in the down on the leg a little bit, maybe even, and in that upper outer tube, call the fluid use of this. Feeling good if you can, bring the hands out and come a little bit more forward, take some deep breaths in, always through your nose, let your body relax forward. Good, coming back. Now,",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

      "answer": "To stretch the arms and promote relaxation, you can perform specific stretches while incorporating deep breathing techniques. One effective method involves bending one arm at a 90-degree angle and sliding it across your lower back. This action targets the trapezius muscle, helping to release tension in the upper back. While in this position, gently tilt your head towards the opposite shoulder to enhance the stretch and further relax the muscles [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 05:34-05:36].\n\nAnother beneficial stretch is the \"Y stretch,\" where you raise your arms to form a 'Y' shape. With your feet together, lean forward using your body weight, which can help elongate the shoulder and upper back muscles. This stretch not only aids in muscle relaxation but also encourages deep breathing as you lean into the stretch [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 06:25-06:27].\n\nIncorporating these stretches with mindful breathing can significantly enhance relaxation and reduce muscle tension. Regular practice can lead to improved flexibility and a greater sense of well-being.",
