Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area. So, use my fingers and any part never use the fingernails, okay? Relax your shoulders, breathe out, and then clasherly apply firm pressure. And then, who's your fingers up to the top of your head? And, come out, again, apply firm pressure. with your fingers and slide them. The top of your head, third one, apply front pressure and raise that relax your shoulders and slide them to the top of your head. Let's do the side and back of your head, right right here. from pushing the scalp and gradually oh, slide them up to the top. Okay, and don't hold your breath, that's also important. Be sound while you are moving your fingers up. And that's one, and turn back. Oh, no way, uh, but, woo! Feel straight.",

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck.

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises.

Ensure your shoulders are relaxed and your head is aligned with your spine.\n\n2. **Execution**: Gently pull your chin straight back towards your neck. Imagine creating a double chin without tilting your head up or down. This movement should be subtle and controlled, focusing on retracting the head rather than pushing it forward [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 08:19-08:22].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain the chin tuck position for a few seconds, typically around 5 seconds. \n\n4. **Release**: Slowly return to the starting position. Repeat this exercise for several repetitions, aiming for 10-15 times per session.\n\n5. **Use of Equipment**: For enhanced effectiveness, consider using a resistance band (taraband) to provide additional support and resistance during the exercise, which can help achieve quicker results [Video 2].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure you do not experience pain while performing chin tucks. If you do, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional for guidance. The provided",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back.

And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

So the first structure that actually cause you a shoulder pin is your neck. shoulder pin can arise from your neck, especially if you're suffering from a ridiculously, which is essentially a nerve which is being pinched in the neck. And you know when you have a ridiculously, because you have this shooting pin from your, from your neck into your shoulder, into your elbow, into your arms, some of the even to your fingers. And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early",

Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain.

About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a link right here. This is another one that you two think you might fix that you might like right here. So we sure to check that out and we'll see you again soon right here on tour with pain.",

You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier.

At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates. You can see that this is not a noxious thing. It's not causing me any discomfort. I'm still sitting here fairly carefully talking to you and not crying kicking your screaming. You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this",

Position yourself so that your arms can rest on the walls, creating a triangular shape with your body.\n\n2. **Position Your Arms**: Place your forearms on each wall, ensuring they are at shoulder height. Your elbows should be slightly below shoulder level to avoid strain.\n\n3. **Step Forward**: Gently step forward into the corner. This movement will stretch the muscles in your neck and shoulders. \n\n4. **Stretch Your Neck**: While in this position, tilt your head away from the side where you feel pain. For example, if your neck pain is on the right side, tilt your head to the left. This action helps elongate the muscles that are tight and painful [Video 1: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\n5. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply to help relax the muscles.\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid pushing into pain.

Have them carefully wrap the left strap over your left shoulder and under your armpit. They should feed the end of the left strap through the left side of the plastic triangle buckle and attach the Velcro closure. Repeat this process with the right strap. The brace should now be in a figure 8 shape. To adjust Just the fit, the person helping to pull the straps tighter or loosen the straps until your desired level of clavicle or posture support is reached. Make sure they adjust one strap by time to prevent further injury. Once on and properly adjusted, you should feel your shoulders being gently pulled back.

So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

And out of pain of course Bob, this is Napoleon, Bonaparte, right? And today we're going to show you the single best treatment you could do for AC joint pain or a chromio-clovicular pain. So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

      "answer": "To put on a clavicle brace, start by unfolding the brace and laying it flat to identify the left and right straps. Next, have someone assist you by positioning the felt back pad behind your shoulder blades, ensuring the plastic triangle points downward. Then, carefully wrap the left strap over your left shoulder and under your armpit, securing it with the Velcro closure. Repeat this process for the right strap, ensuring both straps are snug but not overly tight to avoid discomfort [Video 2: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 01:21-01:26].\n\nThe clavicle brace is designed in a figure-eight pattern, which helps stabilize the collarbone area, allowing for proper healing after a fracture. This design encourages the shoulders to be held back, providing additional support to the clavicle [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 00:46-00:49].\n\nIn summary, putting on a clavicle brace involves laying it flat, positioning the back pad, and wrapping the straps securely around your shoulders. This process is crucial for effective immobilization and healing of the clavicle.",

The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined.

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

A lot of times when people come in and they're having really strange symptoms, I often and you know what that sounds like nerve pain because nerve pain it just gives you a really weird thing you can get like hot colds and shirts yeah depends in needles if you start getting weakness in the arm that's often quite often that's a little more serious that's getting more serious spasms that can be from from nerve compression too and what they want to point out as a therapist or a physician or a character we pay attention to where do you feel the pain, you know, is it on the fronting room or the back of the arm inside the leg outside of the leg? Because that tells us possibly which nerve is actually being pinched. We know it's all mapped out where L3, the nerve coming out of L3, your number is spying where it goes down in your leg. We know how L5 was down at the top of your foot if you feel symptoms there, right? So where you're having the pain, it could be where you're having the pinched nerve but quite often it isn't.",

One of the things to know What you insert the swab is to go in a horizontal configuration to the patient's head. You can see on this diagram behind me and I'll use my swab as a pointer that you're actually going horizontally. You're not going vertically. You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area. If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all.

You will be examining the area above the clavicle, which may require you to position yourself behind the patient.\n\n3. **Examination Technique**: Use both hands to palpate the supraclavicular area gently. Feel for any enlarged lymph nodes or masses. Assess the nodes for size, tenderness, consistency, and mobility, noting any abnormalities. This method of using both hands allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the lymph nodes [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:48-01:56].\n\n4. **Documentation**: Record your findings accurately, noting any significant findings that may require further investigation.\n\nAlways ensure the patient feels comfortable throughout the examination and",

Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

It is crucial to obtain adequate consent before proceeding with the examination, as this builds trust and ensures patient comfort [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Position the patient comfortably, ideally seated, to allow for easy access to the submental area.\n\n3. **Examination Technique**: Use both hands to apply direct pressure underneath the patient's chin. This technique allows for effective palpation of the submental lymph nodes [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:48-01:56]. \n\n4. **Assessment**: While palpating, assess for any abnormalities such as size, tenderness, or consistency of the lymph nodes. Note any masses or nodes that may be present.\n\n5. **Documentation**: After the examination, document your findings accurately for further evaluation and management.\n\nAlways ensure that the patient feels comfortable throughout the examination and explain each step to them to alleviate any anxiety.",

Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

It\u2019s essential to obtain adequate consent before proceeding with the examination, as this builds trust and ensures patient comfort [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Position the patient comfortably, ideally seated. You will primarily examine the lymph nodes from behind the patient, so ensure they are relaxed and at ease.\n\n3. **Examination Technique**: Use both hands to palpate the lymph nodes. Start by examining the submental lymph nodes, applying direct pressure underneath the chin. This allows you to feel for any abnormalities or masses [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:48-01:56].\n\n4. **Assessment**: As you palpate, assess the nodes for size, consistency, tenderness, and mobility. Note any irregularities that may indicate pathology.\n\n5. **Documentation**: After the examination, document your findings and discuss any concerns with the patient.\n\nAlways prioritize patient comfort and ensure that your hands are clean to prevent any risk of infection.",

Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started! So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area.

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

You can see on this diagram behind me and I'll use my swab as a pointer that you're actually going horizontally. You're not going vertically. You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area. If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all.

Introduce yourself to the patient and obtain informed consent. This is crucial as the examination will primarily occur from behind the patient, necessitating clear communication and comfort [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Have the patient seated comfortably, preferably with a relaxed neck and shoulders. This positioning allows for easier access to the lymph nodes.\n\n3. **Examination Technique**: Use both hands to palpate the lymph nodes. For the preauricular nodes, place your fingers just in front of the ear, applying gentle pressure to feel for any enlargement or tenderness. For the postauricular nodes, position your fingers behind the ear in a similar manner [Video 1].\n\n4. **Assessment**: While palpating, assess the nodes for size, consistency, mobility, and tenderness. Note any abnormalities that may indicate pathology.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Document your findings accurately for further evaluation or treatment as necessary.\n\nAlways ensure the patient feels comfortable throughout the examination process, maintaining",

If you don't snore someone in your house in either way, it can affect the whole house. Right. Like I was telling you earlier, my daughter was before she left the house, she didn't just leave. Anyways, she went to the college. We kept her awake many nights from our snoring. Not just me, but my wife as well. And so it's a problem. So, why do you snore? It happens because when you fall asleep, the muscles in your throat, they relax, and with open mouth breathing, it starts to get these vibrations, and you know, it can be like, my dad was just as a chainsaw, you know?

Oh, I mean, I had door shut, and you could hear him. I mean, Yeah, I mean, I think the towel is complaining. Yeah, we don't want to talk about it, right? So I would make the news. What seriously, you can get this look that by a doctor. I think you should. You can talk to them. One thing they might do, this is, we're not doing this video to promote this necessarily because you probably don't need it. But sometimes a sleep study, you",

You ought to seek out a dentist that has technology because it's been around for a while that allows us to fix the tooth and one visit and save more of your tooth structure. Avoid all those challenges and problems that I listed earlier about, you know, tooth pain, less of your tooth around. I mean, I think about it, if you're like a 35 year old and you're getting your tooth cut on to put a crown on it, that crown made the last you 20 years, but in 20 years you're gonna need another crown and when they cut that old one off, there's gonna be even less tooth structure there. So each time you're getting this tooth treated, you're more likely to have it break, hurt, and have problems for you down the road. So just avoid crowns if you can, almost never needed. In dental school, we were taught how to prepare teeth for crowns and not for veneers. So you're gonna, most of the time, run into dentists that are really trained on crown prep and maybe not on veneer prep. And so crowns, you're going to basically take the burr, reduce the tooth about a millimetre on top and cut all the way around, essentially, removing all of your enamel. Now, if the tooth is badly damaged, then maybe this is necessary, The only area that really necessitates or requires us to be bad aggressive and removing the animal all the way",

Now can you try that at home or wherever you are? Head down, pull the shoulders away from your ears and then actually start to activate those lower trapezius muscles I was showing you on the diagram for earlier. Now second step is pull your shoulders away from your ears, squeeze your shoulders together and lift your hands just off the ground and now lower them down slowly and relax.

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym as well or something to lift your pelvis particularly if you're back curve curves in a long way. So it actually stops that large inward curve in you like that. So lying down in this position. Coming down, now your forehead needs to be in contact with the ground, your arms are down and your palm are facing downwards. So I mean that position,",

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

      "answer": "To alleviate chronic neck tension while lying down, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Lie down on your stomach. This position helps engage the middle and lower trapezius muscles, which are crucial for neck stability and tension relief. You may find it beneficial to place a pillow under your pelvis for added comfort and support [Video 1: PdMJAhD7NEw, Time: 02:33-02:37].\n\n2. **Engagement of Muscles**: Focus on engaging your middle traps, which help squeeze your shoulder blades together, and your lower traps, which pull your shoulders back and down. This engagement counteracts the tension created by the upper traps, which often contribute to neck pain [Video 3: PdMJAhD7NEw, Time: 01:58-02:02].\n\n3. **Gentle Movements**: While in this position, you can perform gentle shoulder blade squeezes by consciously pulling your shoulder blades together and down. This should be done slowly and with control to avoid any strain.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you are comfortable and not experiencing any sharp pain while performing these exercises. If discomfort persists, consider consulting a healthcare professional.",

So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back.

Because that tells us possibly which nerve is actually being pinched. We know it's all mapped out where L3, the nerve coming out of L3, your number is spying where it goes down in your leg.

Another one is, could be related as a handcuff neuropathy. There are two types that can actually put pressure on the nerves.

So the first structure that actually cause you a shoulder pin is your neck. shoulder pin can arise from your neck, especially if you're suffering from a ridiculously, which is essentially a nerve which is being pinched in the neck. And you know when you have a ridiculously, because you have this shooting pin from your, from your neck into your shoulder, into your elbow, into your arms, some of the even to your fingers. And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists",

Now it may be in the front of the arm, not always in the back, like we have it here, but down the arm and down the one to the wrist and actually up into the fingers. And that's where a neck problems and carpal tunnel can cross over symptoms, so that's something we have to be careful of. And it can also be, say, between the shoulder blades, too, Ben? Yeah, I don't have, we don't have a piece of tape for that, but yeah, they could radiate down into or refer down to it as well. So those are the common areas, and if your pain is getting worse, it's going to go further down. Right. Right. It's pretty much a rule, thumb that can be relied on. Pretty universal. Yeah, so like if you just have shoulder pain, and it keeps referring down the arm, that shoulder pain is getting worse. If you have just regular neck pain, not even a pinch nerve, but the pain is to go in further down the arm, it's getting worse. So, yeah, so if you're stretching your neck, and maybe the neck feels",

Pinched nerves can cause discomfort in specific areas such as the front or back of the arm, or inside or outside of the leg. The location of the pain can help determine which nerve might be affected [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 02:33-02:38].\n\n2. **Evaluate Pain Quality**: Understand the nature of the pain. Nerve pain is often described as severe and can feel different from mechanical pain, such as that from a fracture. It may also change over time, which is a characteristic feature of nerve-related issues [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 05:53-05:56; Video 3: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 01:53-01:59].\n\n3. **Consider Other Factors**: Be aware that other conditions, like scar tissue, can also exert pressure on nerves, potentially complicating the diagnosis [Video 2].\n\n4. **Consult a Professional**: If",

You wake up in your arms. You can't move your arms. No, they cut off so much that the nurse can not fire the muscles. I never experienced that you are disallent at all. But no, it would be how do you move palsy? You fall asleep with your honies on your arm like this? Yeah, it's like your honey. Yeah, this is my honey. And all I'm longing, you're afraid to get away from her, and there's a joke too about non-hoffware or whatever. That also causes a pausing in your arm. Another one is, could be related as a handcuff neuropathy. There are two types that can actually put pressure on the nerves.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

And while I want to just say this bread, it often is a sign of sleep apnea, and sleep apnea is not to be taken lightly. I mean, it can lead to a lot of medical issues. Right, I've heard people say, I'm not willing to accept this personally yet, but if I ever need one, because I don't want to be hooked up to a thing, but I know many people say, once they got a CPAP, they realized how much sleep they were missing.

If you don't snore someone in your house in either way, it can affect the whole house. Right. Like I was telling you earlier, my daughter was before she left the house, she didn't just leave. Anyways, she went to the college. We kept her awake many nights from our snoring. Not just me, but my wife as well. And so it's a problem. So, why do you snore?

Oh, I mean, I had door shut, and you could hear him. I mean, Yeah, I mean, I think the towel is complaining. Yeah, we don't want to talk about it, right? So I would make the news.

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open.

This condition often occurs when pressure is applied to the nerves while sleeping in a certain position, typically with your arm under your body or head. \n\n1. **Assess Arm Movement**: Check if you can move your arms freely. If you experience difficulty moving them or if they feel weak, this could indicate nerve compression [Video 3: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 08:00-08:05].\n\n2. **Monitor Sensation**: Pay attention to any numbness or tingling sensations in your arms. This can be a sign that the nerves are being pinched or compressed.\n\n3. **Evaluate Positioning**: Consider how you were positioned while sleeping.

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this.

It's a good point Brad because people forget and it may even you know not happen the first day you might do the exercise for a couple days and then they go yeah I can't remember if it's a better enough but if they go you it was a six And now it's only a three years tell me so a good thing is sometimes it's like oh, yeah I forgot to even hit it right it was back in the normal your mind kind of forgets where it was So righty to down like on a calendar or a piece of paper. It's really good Yeah, it's really good to chart. Yeah, so as it gets better You're gonna see the pain hopefully get improved as you move up down We actually have this tape so Brad can show improvement here. Yeah, so yeah So Bob has these symptoms and he starts to stretch his neck in a certain way and this is what happens the next day.

      "answer": "To identify if you may have handcuff neuropathy, observe for specific symptoms and conditions. First, consider whether you experience numbness or weakness in your arms, particularly if you have been in a position that compresses the nerves, such as sleeping with your arm under your head or body. This can lead to a condition where the nerves are unable to function properly, often described as a \"palsy\" or inability to move the affected arm [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 08:00-08:05].\n\nNext, assess your ability to move your arms. If you find that you cannot move your arms fully or experience significant discomfort when trying to do so, this may indicate nerve compression [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:14-07:19]. \n\nIt's important to note that if you experience persistent symptoms, you should seek medical attention to prevent further nerve damage. Additionally, avoid positions that may exacerbate the condition, such as resting on your arms for extended periods. Always prioritize safety and consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation if symptoms persist.",

So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can. And we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet. So even after you blow it out and you feel like you may be empty, I'll still coach it a key, blow and keep pushing, keep going, keep going, and then after a few seconds, I'll ask you to take another fast, you bet that again, and then I'll ask you to come off the mouthpiece.

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs. Where are from the back to the legs are you getting a pinch of hair and which we use you call sciatica sure The other thing we thought we talked about a couple fun ones right, Brad With this some names out there for nerves that could pinched and these are the ones that are generally more of a tempered pinch But what does call serenity policy?

Crutch palsy typically occurs when the radial nerve is compressed, often due to improper use of crutches. \n\n1. **Assess Arm Movement**: Check if you have difficulty moving your arms. A significant sign of crutch palsy is the inability to move your arms properly, which can occur if the nerve is severely compressed [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 08:00-08:05].\n\n2. **Monitor for Numbness**: Pay attention to any numbness or tingling sensations in your arms. This can indicate that the nerves are not firing correctly due to compression.\n\n3. **Evaluate Positioning**: Consider how you are positioning your arms while using crutches. If you tend to rest your weight on your arms for extended periods, this can lead to nerve compression.\n\n4. **Seek Medical Advice**: If you experience persistent symptoms, consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation and potential treatment options.\n\nAlways ensure that you are using crutches correctly to avoid unnecessary strain on your nerves.

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video. Weighted, dorsy flexion Start by sitting on a small stall with a weightlifting plate rested on your knees Drive your knees forward as possible and pass your toes without your heels coming off the ground. Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or",

Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do.

It shifts your weight into other structures such as ligaments, joints, and muscles have compensate and that can cause pain and also promote arthritis or degenerate change.

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

Please check out my three exercises for acute lower back pain. The video will definitely help you get moving again and also prevent lower back pain. I still do those exercises on the daily. Now, if you do have flat feet, there could be a chance that you do have both legs, not knees, where your knees move inwards and you might want to do some exercises to prevent that or improve that, so you don't get the general change and promote flat feet. Please check out my both leg video. The video will definitely help you out.

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

Show you some exercises you can do at home, and then we're going to show you a set set here that was actually provided us to us by F.E.I. again. F.E.I. Fabrication and Apprises Incorporated. This is the catalog. If you are a therapist, I would highly suggest that you grab one and get one. Sure. You go to their website. We'll put that link below, all right. And but they gave us all this stuff. We're not getting paid for this. But we don't get paid for anything to do with that. No, but we only like to represent quality, our products that we like, the good quality products. And we feel good about giving a little bump to them. Plug to them, yeah. OK. By the way, they provide some of these proxure retailers too. And stuff. Sure. Yeah, these will probably be used mostly for therapists.

This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities.

One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists of nerves and blood vessels and it runs essentially from your neck into your shoulder and it can be compressed here, it can be compressed by a muscle or can be compressed by the clavicle or it can be compressed by the first rape even. And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

One, you can of course just do full flexion. And you can work on just flexing the end of the finger tips like this, so you get that pincer grip versus the full. And that's one other one you can do Brad is you can just do pincer like this or put the two fingers together. You can work a pincer on each finger. You can actually work on just extension, of course. And then you can even hook in here and work on flexion like this, individually. So if you want to just work on flexor like this, if you want to break it down on that entailed. So there's a lot of different things you can do with that. So really cool set. Again, you can look at the website below. You know, right now I'm afraid we got to stop and let our occupational therapists have their hand out of it. And remember Brad and I can fix this about anything, except for that broken hurt. I don't know if this is going to help with that. We can make, you know, there you go. Okay, thanks.",

Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

If you do the whole hand, it's 2.5. Now moving up to like the red that's three pounds per finger or ten pounds for the hand. And if you go all the way to the most difficult one, try even the gray one, Brad. These are very difficult. This is 13 pounds per finger and I can't even, you know, I can't even hardly push that down. Right. And especially when you get down to the pinky, oh my god, that's just, but when you do all all of them together, it's amazing how much more you're striking it with the key now. It pushes me to the limit though. That's 43 pounds, sure. That's all right. Got a nice contour here for the palm. So this is a set that it just works out really well for a progression. You always put this in my upside down. Oh, did I put it in my upside down? Yeah, Brad's more of that way. Yeah, if you know what I mean. All right, this is the Digi Extend.

The darker the color the more resistance. And you simply it takes a little time to change the rubber band also we're not going to do that. And you have to necessarily change it. You could put two in it at the same time or double up the resistance. Yep. And the thing about that is, yeah, now it's going to be really tough here. I just got it on two of them or one of them here. And that one is really working now. Right. Yeah, so you can get plenty of resistance. I don't care how tough you are. So the product that I really like, Brad, is this Digi Flex. It's called multi-progressive exercise system. This is really cool. And the reason it's really cool. Now again, we start with the yellow, which is only 1.5. But you can interchange these. So if you're finding one of the fingers is a little bit weak, you can actually put in a heavier dose in there. So they just to change easy to just pull them out.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

You may not be able to, you may have to, you might only get partial way and, you know, Well, then there's some more advanced things you can do as far as, you know, holding one joint and working on trying to get more bend to it. So, next one, number four. Now, this one, you're going to go ahead and just completely flex everything and completely extend everything. Completely flex, completely extend. Okay, it's quiet in here today. Yeah, like a nice. All right, the next one, you're going to make it all with each finger. Oh, oh, oh, good.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

We did a whole video on this. We won't take too much time on this right now. But you just dip it in the paraphernal wax and it just envelopes the whole hand and really provides a good source of heat, really nice for our thrice, really good for moisturizing the skin too. It feels great. Bob did it last time and I wanted to make sure I got in on the cover. I'd want to get in on it, so. All right. Well, Brad's messing around with that. Why don't I go ahead and start off? Oh, let's let me get the laundry done here for you. Yeah, let's let's get that out of here. If you are new to our channel, I'm going to look over there like a pretend someone just came in. Hi. Please subscribe to us.

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps",

Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

      "answer": "To practice speech therapy with an iPad after suffering a stroke, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify Goals**: Determine specific areas to focus on, such as short-term memory and deductive reasoning skills, which are often addressed in speech therapy post-stroke [Video 1: LqMs2kA5Y88, Time: 01:10-01:17; Video 2: LqMs2kA5Y88, Time: 02:07-02:12].\n\n2. **Select Appropriate Apps**: Use speech therapy apps designed to enhance communication skills and cognitive functions. Look for apps that target memory exercises and reasoning tasks.\n\n3. **Engage in Activities**: Incorporate activities that require multitasking and attention division. This can include games that challenge memory recall or problem-solving skills [Video 2].\n\n4. **Practice Regularly**: Set aside time daily to engage with the iPad, ensuring consistent practice to reinforce skills.\n\n5. **Monitor Progress**: Keep track of improvements and challenges. Adjust activities based on progress to ensure continued engagement and effectiveness.\n\n6. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure a comfortable and distraction-free environment while using the iPad to maximize focus and minimize frustration",

Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates. You can see that this is not a noxious thing. It's not causing me any discomfort. I'm still sitting here fairly carefully talking to you and not crying kicking your screaming. You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this",

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

          "text": "A foot sprain is an injury to the ligaments in the foot that help hold the arch together. The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

      "answer": "To wash your skin after radiation therapy, follow these steps for optimal care:\n\n1. **Daily Washing**: It is essential to wash your skin daily to maintain cleanliness and promote healing. Use your hands to splash lukewarm water on the affected areas. Avoid using washcloths, sponges, or loofahs, as these can irritate the skin further [Video 1: M6WV95X0fRk, Time: 00:37-00:40].\n\n2. **Gentle Cleansing**: If you need to cleanse the skin, opt for a gentle low pH cleanser. This type of cleanser is less likely to disrupt the skin's natural barrier and is suitable for sensitive skin. Be careful not to scrub at any lines drawn on your skin, as this can cause irritation or damage [Video 1: M6WV95X0fRk, Time: 00:37-00:40].\n\n3. **Moisturizing**: After washing, apply a moisturizer to help your skin heal more quickly. Moisturizers can provide necessary hydration and support the skin's recovery process [Video 1: M6WV95X0fRk, Time: 00:37",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

But once we hit a very deep but comfortable stretch, what I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a little bit like this. This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release. I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief. If the exercise is held, please support the channel by giving this video like and maybe subscribing to the channel too. If you have any comments or questions, please leave them below. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

We don't want to do this one on the lower back because that can cause irritation, but just roll up and down, just allowing gravity to take your shoulders, elbows and head down just like this. And with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop crack or cell for leaves. But you can do this one nice and slowly up and down for about 5 to 10 complete repetitions. If you do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do this certain step, but you should be able to do the others. So let's say that you have one spot that just will not release. It's really tight, achy and painful and it needs a little bit more attention. Let's stop right over that spot. From there what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much as we can, really put the back into a backwards extension just like this, and then from there I'm going to plant my feet on the floor and then lift my butt up, kind of like creating a bridge like exercise.

The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those. It's a top three exercises for neck pain and posture.",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

      "answer": "To perform an upper back opener exercise for self-release and instant pain relief, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by finding a comfortable position, either sitting or standing. Ensure your back is straight and relaxed.\n\n2. **Identify the Pain Area**: Focus on the tight or painful spots in your upper or middle back. This will help you target the right areas during the exercise [Video 1].\n\n3. **Movement**: Gently extend your arms overhead and interlace your fingers. As you do this, lean slightly backward while keeping your core engaged. This movement helps to open up the upper back and relieve tension.\n\n4. **Breathing**: Inhale deeply as you stretch, allowing your chest to expand. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, then exhale as you return to the starting position. Repeat this several times to enhance the release effect.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: Always listen to your body. If you experience sharp pain or discomfort, stop the exercise immediately. It\u2019s important to avoid overextending or forcing any movements that could lead to injury [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41].\n\nThis exercise",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most.

From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release. So here is what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch, and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving. This one is best done at the edge of a bed, but you can also do this one on the floor. What I'm going to do is start with one leg straight. Usually the leg that's closest towards the edge of the bed. And then the other side, what I'm going to do is bend the knee and then keep the foot flat. I'm just going to press into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press down for stable anchor point. Let's take the hand that's closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge. Just for a little bit more support. What I'm going to do from there is bend the other sides arm, so in this case, I'm going to take my right elbow and I'm going to place it on the inside of my right knee. From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

      "answer": "To perform an upper back opener exercise using the edge of your bed for self-release, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit on the edge of your bed with your feet flat on the floor. Lean back slightly, allowing your upper back to rest against the edge of the bed. This position helps target the upper and middle back areas effectively [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41].\n\n2. **Movement**: Begin by sliding your upper back up and down the edge of the bed. You can perform this movement for about three to five repetitions. As you slide, you can adjust your position slightly to target different areas of tension in your back [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 02:19-02:23].\n\n3. **Adding Stretch**: To enhance the stretch, you can gently wing your elbows downwards while maintaining your position. This action can help increase the release in your upper back [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 02:51-02:53].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you only slide down to your",

I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder the other side shoulder When you do this you'll really feel it open up into the neck right here and a lot of times You'll get a sudden pop crack or release into the neck or into the upper back It usually feels really good again with this one don't try to force it You want to hold this one for about 15 to",

To focus a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y stretch. So I'm going to put my arms up just like this to the point where I can then lean into it like this. So I'm putting my Y or my arms into a Y, my feet go together and then I'm just is using my body weight to lean forward towards the corner of that wall. This feels really good. You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it",

My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So for demonstrated purposes, I will be using my can of soup. So if you are using the soup can, just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like this and then roll it up and you kind of have a homemade foam roller. So there I'm just going to position it right on the upper back. So I just go",

Almost, if you have a wall or something behind you, you're chair behind you, just try and push your head into the wall or the chair. And you see, you have lots of little chins right there. And so you just wanna hold that position, you might feel some tightness in the back, you might feel some tightness in the front as well. And hold that for about three to five seconds, and then relax. You can do those five times, you can do them several times throughout the day. But again, you're just taking that chin, tucking it in, and getting that, you're working the muscles, and you're stretching the muscles at the same time. So it's a really great exercise, combination stretch, to really kind of reset everything. And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well.

Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump. Often people who experience a neck hump or a buffalo hump also experience a bit of neck pain as well. I've done some",

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before",

This setup is crucial for effectively targeting the upper trapezius muscles [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 04:48-04:52].\n\n2. **Position Your Body**: Stand facing the corner, placing one arm against the wall. Angle your body slightly away from the wall to create tension in the upper trapezius. This positioning helps to stretch the muscle effectively [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 04:23-04:25].\n\n3. **Stretch and Release**: Begin by gently leaning into the corner, allowing your shoulder to drop down while tilting your head towards the opposite shoulder. Hold this position for about 20 seconds to relax the muscle [Video 3: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 06:11-06:14].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat this stretch up to five times, gradually increasing the angle and depth of the stretch",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

So I'm putting my Y or my arms into a Y, my feet go together and then I'm just is using my body weight to lean forward towards the corner of that wall. This feels really good. You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it",

I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder the other side shoulder When you do this you'll really feel it open up into the neck right here and a lot of times You'll get a sudden pop crack or release into the neck or into the upper back It usually feels really good again with this one don't try to force it You want to hold this one for about 15 to",

Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there. And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release. So here is what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch, and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving. This one is best done at the edge of a bed, but you can also do this one on the floor. What I'm going to do is start with one leg straight. Usually the leg that's closest towards the edge of the bed.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

To focus a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y stretch.

You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump. Often people who experience a neck hump or a buffalo hump also experience a bit of neck pain as well. I've done some",

One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Place your arms in a \"Y\" shape, with your elbows slightly bent and your hands resting on the wall, ensuring your body is at an angle that feels comfortable [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 04:48-04:52].\n\n2. **Stretching**: Gently lean into the corner, allowing your chest to move towards the wall while keeping your hips back. This will create a stretch in your upper back and shoulders. \n\n3. **Adjusting the Stretch**: After holding the stretch for about 20 seconds, relax and then on the next repetition, drive your arms over a little more and tilt your ear towards the shoulder to enhance the stretch [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 06:11-06:14].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Perform several repetitions, focusing on areas that feel particularly tight. Target specific spots that need more attention for optimal relief [Video 1: _bZHLRfV",

If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot.

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release. I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief.

If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

Ensure your back is straight and relaxed.\n\n2. **Arm Placement**: Raise the arm on the side where you feel tightness or discomfort. Place your elbow up, which helps push the shoulder blade down, facilitating a better stretch [Video 3: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 02:55-03:02].\n\n3. **Neck Movement**: While keeping your arm in position, gently turn your head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. This movement helps to elongate the muscles on the side that is already tight, providing relief [Video 2: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\n4. **Stretch Duration**: Hold this position for several seconds, allowing your muscles to relax and release tension. \n\n5. **Safety Note**: If you experience discomfort in your shoulder or if the stretch feels painful, modify your arm position or reduce the intensity of the stretch to avoid injury [Video 3: x",

If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

If you do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do this certain step, but you should be able to do the others. So let's say that you have one spot that just will not release. It's really tight, achy and painful and it needs a little bit more attention. Let's stop right over that spot. From there what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much as we can, really put the back into a backwards extension just like this, and then from there I'm going to plant my feet on the floor and then lift my butt up, kind of like creating a bridge like exercise.

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release. I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief.

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

Ensure your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed.\n\n2. **Identify Pain Points**: Focus on the tight or painful areas in your upper or middle back. This is crucial for effective self-release.\n\n3. **Movement**: Gently extend your upper back by arching it backward. You can do this by placing your hands behind your head and leaning back slightly. This motion helps mobilize the spine and relieve tension [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41].\n\n4. **Breathing**: As you extend your back, take deep breaths. Inhale deeply as you arch back, and exhale as you return to the neutral position. This helps in relaxing the muscles further.\n\n5. **Repetition**: Repeat this movement several times, ensuring you do not overextend or cause discomfort. Listen to your body and stop if you feel any sharp pain.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always consult with a healthcare professional if you have underlying conditions or if the pain persists after performing",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

From there what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much as we can, really put the back into a backwards extension just like this, and then from there I'm going to plant my feet on the floor and then lift my butt up, kind of like creating a bridge like exercise. This time what's going to happen is that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the can into the floor, and it really intensifies the stretch. It feels really, really good for me. And if that joint is locked up, this might get it too self-release. but you can hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds. If it feels good, hold it for longer. You can hold it upwards towards the minute, but we need to breathe out just lower your butt down like this. And then repeat it about three to five times. From there, you can just switch over different spots as needed. If it still feels like it does not watch release, what we can do from there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement.

We don't want to do this one on the lower back because that can cause irritation, but just roll up and down, just allowing gravity to take your shoulders, elbows and head down just like this. And with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop crack or cell for leaves. But you can do this one nice and slowly up and down for about 5 to 10 complete repetitions. If you do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do this certain step, but you should be able to do the others. So let's say that you have one spot that just will not release. It's really tight, achy and painful and it needs a little bit more attention. Let's stop right over that spot. From there what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much as we can, really put the back into a backwards extension just like this, and then from there I'm going to plant my feet on the floor and then lift my butt up, kind of like creating a bridge like exercise.

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release. I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief.

Now have you had the problem where you're repeatedly need to get treatment for getting tight neck and shoulders, you get your treatment, you have to go back, it feels great but you have to go back then a couple of days later to get treated again and the neck gets tight again. Today I'm going to show you a couple of simple exercises to get some permanent relief and to to overcome this typical problem of being tight through this area of your neck and shoulders all the time. So I'm going to talk about a couple of exercises and they really simple exercises you can start doing at home or in the gym for these muscles that we need to look at. Let's get started. Okay, so before we start, I just needed to bear with me for a moment so I can show you which muscles you're working and why. So this is the poster of this superficial outer back muscles and you can see in the purple clear these muscles. These are called your trapezius muscles. Now there's three parts to these muscles and you need to know about all of them to properly address this problem. There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll",

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

They say, well, somewhere you have a pensioner. We're going to talk about where you can pensioner and what it is and what symptoms it is. So first let's talk about the symptoms. What are the things you're going to feel when you have a pensioner? One thing you might have quite often is pain because you're getting compression on a nurse. What is happening? And the nurse are coming out from your spinal cord and going from the spinal cord into your arms and into your legs. And in this area they wrap around the trunk. Sure, they wrap around the trunk. So you can get actually pain or compression of a nerve anywhere in the body in an essence, right? So let's start talking about some of the common symptoms you're going to feel. First off, you can have pain, you can have radiant pain, pain that's going down, right?

      "answer": "To perform dynamic movements in an extension exercise for self-releasing your upper back, you can follow specific techniques aimed at alleviating tightness and pain. One effective method involves mobilizing your head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. For instance, if you experience discomfort on one side of your upper back, gently stretch and turn your head away from the painful area. This action helps lengthen the muscles that may be tight or overactive, providing relief [Video 2: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\nAdditionally, focusing on dynamic movements that incorporate extension can enhance the release of tension in the upper back. These movements should be performed in a controlled manner, ensuring that you maintain proper posture to avoid further strain. Engaging in these techniques can lead to instant pain relief by promoting better mobility and reducing muscle tightness [Video 1].\n\nIn summary, utilizing dynamic movements that involve stretching the neck away from pain and incorporating controlled extension exercises can effectively self-release tension in the upper back, leading to significant pain relief.",

          "text": "Hey, guys, it's Dr. Spashman's also. I'm going to show you how you use a suction cup as well as your fingers to decrease inner ankle pain associated with running. Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than the other so you can grab the skin and start to move again but I just can see it's hard to grab. That's why I have the suction cup. So with the suction cups you can go in and around first the area right here where we can do the tarsal tunnel and do some simple movements or even if you like, if you have problems with running, if you have problems with impact, put it on there and jog around. be surprised that it might just reduce and keep the camera where it's at right there. So as I stand right here and as I go through some lunging, okay, or as I go through some hop-in, this is all good and fine to do as well,",

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch with an increase of range of motion for ankle mobility. The same or weight lifting plate is now typically two times heavier on the ankle joint since the weight is only acting on one leg and not two. If you don't have a weight lifting plate, you can always be creative and use something heavy to press down on top of your knees. Here",

And all of a sudden the stuff starts to dissipate and you wonder, why the heck did the suction cup or skin pulling work with this thing, right? It's just a way to desense ties the area. So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is.

      "answer": "To reduce ankle pain using skin rolling, you can utilize a suction cup and your fingers to target specific areas around the ankle. Dr. Spashman demonstrates this technique to alleviate inner ankle pain, particularly behind the medial malleolus and extending into the arch or heel of the foot, which is often associated with running injuries. This method can help in releasing tension and improving blood circulation in the affected areas, potentially leading to pain relief.\n\nWhile the video does not provide a detailed step-by-step guide on skin rolling specifically, it emphasizes the importance of addressing pain in the inner ankle region through manual techniques. By applying pressure and rolling the skin, you may help to alleviate discomfort and promote healing in the ligaments and soft tissues surrounding the ankle joint. \n\nIn summary, using skin rolling techniques, such as suction cups and finger pressure, can be beneficial for managing ankle pain, especially in runners experiencing discomfort in specific areas around the ankle [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 00:34-00:38].",

Don't worry too much about the red dots, it's just blood kind of coming to the surface because it is a suction cup, but we're not trying to pull blood or anything like that or do any acupuncture, okay. So these are just simple things you can do with a suction cup. You can get them for like five bucks on Amazon, you get like a whole set. And you'd be surprised you do this pretty frequently throughout the day, like five times or so. And all of a sudden the stuff starts to dissipate and you wonder, why the heck did the suction cup or skin pulling work with this thing, right? It's just a way to desense ties the area. So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations. So that's really how you kind of lock these feelings in and make it feel better for the long haul. So if you guys like this, give me a thumbs up in this video and share it with a friend who's",

Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates. You can see that this is not a noxious thing. It's not causing me any discomfort. I'm still sitting here fairly carefully talking to you and not crying kicking your screaming. You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this",

      "answer": "To reduce ankle pain using a suction cup, you can apply the suction cup to the affected area around the ankle, particularly near the tarsal tunnel. This technique helps mobilize the skin and underlying tissues, which can alleviate discomfort associated with conditions like plantar fasciitis or pain behind the medial malleolus. The suction cup creates a negative pressure that encourages blood flow to the surface, which may aid in healing and reduce pain sensations [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 02:06-02:09; Video 2: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 01:50-01:52].\n\nDr. Spashman emphasizes that suction cups can be particularly effective for inner ankle pain related to running, as they help to address issues in the surrounding soft tissues [Video 3: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 00:34-00:38]. \n\nIn summary, using a suction cup on the ankle can facilitate tissue movement and improve circulation, potentially leading to pain relief. This method is simple and can be performed at home with affordable suction cups available online.",

These are great ways to avoid long-term challenges or problems with your teeth. So I would encourage you to go to a dentist who has the ability to create same-day restorations. That'll be a big benefit to you. And go to a dentist who understands how to prepare teeth for veneers and doesn't require or recommend crowns when the backside of the tooth is healthy. The topic of this video came up from just this last week. I had a patient come in and had some concerns with their smile and wanted to improve it. And they came to me and they were fairly young and they were recommended to have. I believe it was like 20 crowns performed and prepped on their teeth. And they were very young. Obviously it's a big concern to me. I advise the patient definitely don't do that. Go to a dentist that is going to be able to prepare the teeth much more minimally so you have the best chance of having long term health there and here at Innovative Dental, we pride ourselves in that. So hopefully this video is helpful. My goal here is to just try to educate and bring some insight",

Chances are if you've gone to your dentist or been concerned about having your front teeth addressed from tooth decay or even just not pleased with the way that they look, you may have been advised to get crowns done on your front teeth. There's some reasons why I would encourage a patient not to go down that route. Most of the time, we can avoid that. First, they're too aggressive. So when you are cutting on a tooth to prepare it for a crown, you have to remove almost all of the enamel. And this leaves the tooth more susceptible to fracture, more subtler break. It also would make the tooth likely to have more sensitivity and maybe even need a root canal in the future. So when you crown a tooth and you cut all the enamel away, it's definitely more likely to be a problem down the road. And you might ask yourself, so why in the world do we have to cut all the way around the tooth? And one of the reasons that we do that is for decades, we've not really had another solution to making the tooth have some sort of temporary why the lab makes your crown. And so we have to put a temporary plastic tooth on top of your existing prep on that basically the tooth that",

I mean, I think about it, if you're like a 35 year old and you're getting your tooth cut on to put a crown on it, that crown made the last you 20 years, but in 20 years you're gonna need another crown and when they cut that old one off, there's gonna be even less tooth structure there.

When you get your new inhaler from the pharmacy, you need to prime or waste it by spraying the medicine into the air four times. Now, fit your inhaler into the opening at the end of the spacer. Shake the inhaler well for 10 seconds. Turn your head to the side and breathe out. Close mouth around mouthpiece of spacer. Push down on the inhaler once. Now the medicine is inside the spacer. Right away, take a slow, deep breath. The goal is not to hear a whistling sound. If you do, this means that you're breathing in too fast. Hold your breath for a count of 10. Now slowly breathe out. Rinse your mouth out with water, or brush teeth, or get a drink after using controller medicines, such as inhaled steroids. Many times, the correct dose of your medicine will be to inhaled two puffs. If this is what is prescribed for you, then wait one minute after the first puff, and then follow all of the steps again. Remember, if you have questions, call your doctor's office as a care team or pharmacy. You",

When a traditional crown is placed on the backside of front teeth, it modifies the natural occlusal surface to a prosthetic one, which can disrupt the normal bite mechanics. This change can lead to an improper alignment of the bite, potentially causing discomfort or further dental issues [Video 1: LL854--GBy4, Time: 05:34-05:36; Video 3: LL854--GBy4, Time: 06:08-06:11].\n\nAdditionally, the area where natural teeth typically experience the least decay is often preserved during dental procedures, but crowning alters this area, which may not provide significant benefits to the patient [Video 2: LL854--GBy4, Time: 04:30-04:35]. \n\nIn summary, the crowning process changes the natural biting surface to a prosthetic one, which can affect bite alignment and overall dental health. It is essential to consider these changes when evaluating the necessity of crowns for dental restoration.",

By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

      "answer": "To strengthen the eyes during stroke therapy by following a finger, you can perform a simple exercise that involves eye movement. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit comfortably in a chair with a clear view of your therapist or a designated finger target.\n\n2. **Eye Rolling**: Begin by rolling your eyes in a circular pattern. Start by looking up, then move your gaze to the side, down, and back to the starting point. Repeat this motion several times to engage all eye muscles. This exercise helps improve eye coordination and strength [Video 1: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 00:31-00:40].\n\n3. **Follow the Finger**: Next, your therapist may hold a finger or an object in front of you. Slowly sway your head from side to side while keeping your eyes focused on the tip of the finger. Ensure that your eyes do not leave the target as you move your head. This exercise is designed to enhance visual tracking and stability [Video 1: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 01:38-01:40].\n\n**Safety Note**: Perform these exercises slowly and avoid any rapid movements to prevent dizziness or strain. Always",

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps",

If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

Ensure you have a cone or a similar object that can serve as a focal point.\n\n2. **Eye Movement Exercise**: Begin by focusing on the cone. Slowly roll your eyes in a circular pattern around the cone. Start by looking up towards the top of the cone, then move your gaze to the right side, down to the bottom, and finally to the left side, completing the circle. Repeat this motion several times to engage all eye muscles effectively [Video 3: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 00:31-00:40].\n\n3. **Focus and Coordination**: As you perform the circular eye movements, ensure that your head remains still to isolate the eye muscles. This will help improve coordination and strengthen the eye muscles.\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim for 5-10 repetitions of the circular motion, and then you can switch directions to further enhance muscle engagement.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: If you experience any discomfort or strain during the exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional.\n\nThis exercise",

And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

Hold a pen or a similar object in front of you at eye level.\n\n2. **Focus on the Tip**: Begin by focusing your gaze on the tip of the pen. This will be your focal point throughout the exercise.\n\n3. **Swaying Motion**: Slowly sway the pen from side to side. As you do this, ensure that your eyes remain fixed on the tip of the pen. The goal is to follow the pen's movement without letting your eyes wander away from it. This exercise helps improve visual tracking and coordination [Video 1: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 01:38-01:40].\n\n4. **Circular Eye Movements**: Additionally, you can incorporate circular eye movements. While still focusing on the pen, roll your eyes in a circular pattern\u2014moving your gaze all the way up, around, and back to the starting point. This helps in strengthening the eye muscles [Video 1: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 00:31-00:40].\n\n**Safety Note**: Perform these exercises slowly and",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would take that measurement and then divide it into two. So if you had four inches on the ruler, you would take an actually mark on your swab where two inches would be. So in this case, you would mark right about the junction of the thick portion of the swab narrowing down. In the case of the adult on this particular swab that works out perfectly almost every time for this junction to be the correct of insertion with the child or an infant you're going to go a little less deep so measuring is often very good especially in the younger kids so that you don't insert the swab too far.

And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists of nerves and blood vessels and it runs essentially from your neck into your shoulder and it can be compressed here, it can be compressed by a muscle or can be compressed by the clavicle or it can be compressed by the first rape even. And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut",

I specialize in pediatric emergency medicine. I also do a lot of point of care testing research in children and adults. I'm here today to help produce a video To help train people have to do correct nasopharyngeal swabs. My expertise in point of care testing has had me to obtain several thousand of these. So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting",

At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates. You can see that this is not a noxious thing. It's not causing me any discomfort. I'm still sitting here fairly carefully talking to you and not crying kicking your screaming. You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this",

And you might ask yourself, so why in the world do we have to cut all the way around the tooth? And one of the reasons that we do that is for decades, we've not really had another solution to making the tooth have some sort of temporary why the lab makes your crown. And so we have to put a temporary plastic tooth on top of your existing prep on that basically the tooth that we just cut now. And that plastic tooth has to have some sort of shape to hold on to. And so that's why we were taught in dental school to cut around the tooth to prepare it in a way that would hold the temporary. So we're really treating the tooth based off of our necessity to put a temporary on it. Now fast forward, right? The technology's come a long way. And now we can actually make the crown while in one visit, while you are here. And we don't require a lab to make the restoration anymore. So since we don't need a lab, you can imagine we don't have to have a temporary, and since we don't need a temporary, we don't have to shape",

      "answer": "To measure the depth of insertion while collecting nasopharyngeal samples for flu testing, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Ensure you are wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and a mask, to protect yourself from potential exposure to respiratory droplets [Video 2: kSpggqOLgaU, Time: 05:00-05:06].\n\n2. **Swab Selection**: Use a nasopharyngeal swab that is designed for this purpose. \n\n3. **Insertion Depth**: The depth of insertion for the swab should typically reach the nasopharynx. A common guideline is to insert the swab until you feel resistance, which usually occurs when the swab reaches the back of the nasal cavity. This is often around 5 to 7 centimeters for adults, but may vary based on the patient's age and anatomy.\n\n4. **Sample Collection**: Rotate the swab gently against the nasopharyngeal wall for a few seconds to collect the sample.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Be mindful of the patient\u2019s comfort and watch for any signs of distress, as the procedure can induce coughing [Video 2: kSpggqOL",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

I'm a pediatric emergency medicine physician who also does a lot of point of care research and I work in the Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas in Austin, Texas. I specialize in pediatric emergency medicine. I also do a lot of point of care testing research in children and adults. I'm here today to help produce a video To help train people have to do correct nasopharyngeal swabs. My expertise in point of care testing has had me to obtain several thousand of these. So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting",

So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can. And we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet. So even after you blow it out and you feel like you may be empty, I'll still coach it a key, blow and keep pushing, keep going, keep going, and then after a few seconds, I'll ask you to take another fast, you bet that again, and then I'll ask you to come off the mouthpiece.

At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates. You can see that this is not a noxious thing. It's not causing me any discomfort. I'm still sitting here fairly carefully talking to you and not crying kicking your screaming. You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this",

The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on top of your shoulder. So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint.

And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists of nerves and blood vessels and it runs essentially from your neck into your shoulder and it can be compressed here, it can be compressed by a muscle or can be compressed by the clavicle or it can be compressed by the first rape even. And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut",

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So the first structure that actually cause you a shoulder pin is your neck. shoulder pin can arise from your neck, especially if you're suffering from a ridiculously, which is essentially a nerve which is being pinched in the neck. And you know when you have a ridiculously, because you have this shooting pin from your, from your neck into your shoulder, into your elbow, into your arms, some of the even to your fingers. And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists",

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs. Where are from the back to the legs are you getting a pinch of hair and which we use you call sciatica sure The other thing we thought we talked about a couple fun ones right, Brad With this some names out there for nerves that could pinched and these are the ones that are generally more of a tempered pinch But what does call serenity policy?

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

          "text": "For the top three exercises for neck pain and posture, exercise number one is the chin tuck. What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

Bye Okay, so a quick and the neck is usually a muscular thing and it typically happens in one or two ways. One is kind of a neck strain that you get from maybe lifting something too heavy or doing an exercise where you really kind of strain into your neck. And the second way is when you have your head in a position and it can be either way where the pain in the neck can come from this part of the side of the neck where the muscles have been compressed in or too short or it can be from this side where the muscles are stretched in too long. It's usually this side, I find, in most of my patients. So you will also feel a lot of times with neck pain. You also feel it kind of going down into the shoulder blade.

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck. So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

Almost, if you have a wall or something behind you, you're chair behind you, just try and push your head into the wall or the chair. And you see, you have lots of little chins right there. And so you just wanna hold that position, you might feel some tightness in the back, you might feel some tightness in the front as well. And hold that for about three to five seconds, and then relax. You can do those five times, you can do them several times throughout the day. But again, you're just taking that chin, tucking it in, and getting that, you're working the muscles, and you're stretching the muscles at the same time. So it's a really great exercise, combination stretch, to really kind of reset everything. And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well.

So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Lay flat on your back on a comfortable surface, bending your knees for added comfort [Video 3: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 00:48-00:52].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Place the rolled towel behind the arch of your neck. This helps maintain proper alignment while you perform the exercise.\n\n3. **Chin Tuck Execution**: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest. Imagine creating a double chin; this movement should be subtle and controlled. Hold this position for a few seconds before releasing [Video 3: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 00:48-00:52].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10-15 repetitions, ensuring that you maintain a relaxed posture throughout the exercise. \n\n5. **Safety Notes**: Avoid straining your neck or lifting your head too high during the tuck. Focus on controlled movements to prevent any discomfort",

This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching the top of my ear. Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one",

So we could say, today, Joe, you did 80%. Next week, you do 95%. So it gives you that concrete evidence. Essentially, what it's going to do is it's going to record how long it takes you to touch the number that they say. 46, four, two. And I write, and it gives you that nice, nice auditory feedback. So that one was definitely a lot quicker. Okay, the first one was 38, the second one, I mean, excuse me, the first one was 85, the second one was 38. So let's definitely improve and give it another try. Okay. 25. 59. 39.",

      "answer": "To use ear drops effectively, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Have the person lie on their side with the ear that needs treatment facing upwards. This allows gravity to assist in the drops reaching the ear canal effectively [Video 1: v0HODFTrkqs, Time: 00:18-00:24].\n\n2. **Preparation**: Gently pull the outer ear (pinna) upwards and backwards to straighten the ear canal. This helps in visualizing the ear canal and ensures the drops can reach deeper [Video 1].\n\n3. **Application**: Administer one drop into the ear canal. It is crucial to apply the drops directly into the ear canal for maximum effectiveness [Video 1].\n\n4. **Assistance**: After applying a drop, press gently on the front of the ear. This action helps the drop travel down towards the eardrum, enhancing absorption [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repeat**: Continue applying drops as directed, ensuring that all prescribed drops are used.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always check the expiration date of the ear drops and ensure the dropper does not touch the ear to avoid contamination. If there is any discomfort or unusual symptoms, consult",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists of nerves and blood vessels and it runs essentially from your neck into your shoulder and it can be compressed here, it can be compressed by a muscle or can be compressed by the clavicle or it can be compressed by the first rape even. And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test.

Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your",

So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on top of your shoulder. So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down.",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just",

Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

      "answer": "To properly treat a foot sprain, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rest**: Limit movement and rest the injured foot as much as possible. This helps prevent further injury and promotes healing. Sit whenever you can to avoid putting weight on the foot [Video 1: bUgV89cdfTM, Time: 00:43-00:48].\n\n2. **Elevation**: Elevate your foot to the level of your chest. This can help reduce swelling and improve blood circulation to the injured area. Use pillows to support your foot while resting [Video 1: bUgV89cdfTM, Time: 00:43-00:48].\n\n3. **Ice**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided videos, applying ice to the sprained area can help reduce swelling and pain. It's generally recommended to ice the injury for 15-20 minutes every few hours during the first couple of days.\n\n4. **Exercises**: Once the initial pain and swelling decrease, gentle exercises can help restore strength and flexibility. For example, you can perform exercises like pinching a tennis ball with your heels while seated to strengthen the foot muscles [Video 2: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 01",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each.

      "answer": "To identify if an exercise is mitigating pain, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess Pain Location**: Begin by identifying the area where you feel pain. For instance, if you have pain on one side of your neck, this will guide your movements.\n\n2. **Perform Opposite Movements**: Engage in gentle stretching by moving your head and neck away from the painful side. For example, if your neck hurts on the right side, turn your head to the left and stretch in that direction. This technique aims to lengthen the muscles on the side opposite to the pain, which can help alleviate discomfort [Video 1: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\n3. **Monitor Pain Levels**: While performing the exercise, pay attention to any changes in your pain levels. If the pain decreases or feels more manageable after a few repetitions, the exercise may be effective.\n\n4. **Incorporate Stretching**: Combine movements with gentle stretches to reset your posture. This can help improve alignment and reduce pain. After doing two or three stretches, you should notice a difference in your posture and pain levels [Video 3: xYFeFFzFftw",

You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can.

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective.

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

It's usually this side, I find, in most of my patients. So you will also feel a lot of times with neck pain. You also feel it kind of going down into the shoulder blade. So you can kind of see here this muscle here, the levator scape kind of comes off the vertebrae and comes down out to the shoulder blade. So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good.

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

Then, move to an L position by keeping your elbows at your sides and extending your arms outwards, pulling them back. Hold this position for another 30 seconds. This exercise helps strengthen the muscles in your upper back and improve posture, which is crucial for reducing the neck hump [Video 2: T43753AfaKY, Time: 02:33-02:35].\n\n2. **Wall Slide Exercise**: Stand next to a wall and slide your right arm up the wall while tilting your head back slightly. Hold this position for about 30 seconds while breathing out. This exercise targets the muscles around the neck and upper back, promoting better alignment and reducing the hump [Video 3: T43753AfaKY, Time: 03:28-03:36].\n\n**Safety Considerations**: Ensure that you maintain a comfortable range of motion and avoid any positions that cause pain. Focus on controlled movements and proper breathing throughout the exercises [Video 1].",

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already",

If you're struggling to hold each position for 10 seconds, repeat five times, what you do is do the A first for 10 seconds, then you move to the T, then you move to the Y, you hold each about 10 seconds and you give yourself a rest. I do 80 y again. A brilliant exercise to reduce the neck hump. Just a quick one. If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

They have the chin sticking forward. There's too much pressure going on on this area here And that can give you a bottle of hump or a neck hump Now the good news is there's something you can do about it and and I'll give you three really simple A very effective exercise if you're to help you where that shouldn't take too long It's persistency that that's the key But the first thing you need to do is sort out your posture. So make sure you're nice and and upright show this back in and so you don't create that constant tension on this area there. So before I continue with the exercises I really enjoy making these videos for you but if you could just help me out and just like it or comment in the box below I really really would appreciate it. Okay so the first exercise is a YWTL exercise. In the sense what we're trying to do is to stretch out straight",

      "answer": "To perform an advanced prayer exercise aimed at reducing the neck hump, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Posture Setup**: Begin by ensuring you are in a comfortable, upright position. Good posture is essential to effectively target the neck area and reduce the hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 01:16-01:19].\n\n2. **Exercise Execution**: The exercise involves a series of movements often referred to as A, T, and Y positions. Start with the 'A' position, holding it for 10 seconds. Then transition to the 'T' position for another 10 seconds, followed by the 'Y' position, also for 10 seconds. Repeat this sequence five times [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 03:27-03:32].\n\n3. **Intensity Consideration**: This exercise can be intense. If you find it challenging to hold each position for the full 10 seconds, it is acceptable to reduce the duration or the number of repetitions until you build strength [Video 2].\n\n4. **Consistency**: Regular practice of these exercises, combined with maintaining good posture, will significantly help in reducing the neck hump",

If you're struggling to hold each position for 10 seconds, repeat five times, what you do is do the A first for 10 seconds, then you move to the T, then you move to the Y, you hold each about 10 seconds and you give yourself a rest. I do 80 y again. A brilliant exercise to reduce the neck hump. Just a quick one. If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time",

You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up.

We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those. It's a top three exercises for neck pain and posture.",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

Tuck your chin in to avoid letting your head drop forward, as this can worsen the neck hump [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n2. **Engage Your Arms**: Push your upper body through your arms while maintaining a strong posture. This will help mobilize and strengthen the lower part of your neck [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 03:27-03:32].\n\n3. **Perform the Stretch**: Execute the A, T, and Y positions. Hold each position for about 10 seconds. If you find it challenging to hold for the full duration, you can start with shorter holds and gradually increase them [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 03:27-03:32].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat this sequence five times to effectively mobilize and strengthen the targeted areas [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 03:",

So what we need to do is next to the exercise, you need to find a way to look at your phone that places less pressure on your neck, and I've got the right hack for you. All you need to do, super simple, all you need to do is support the arm that holds your phone with the other hand to look. What I'm doing now is I'm supporting my elbow of the hand that holds my phone upright, suddenly my phone is upright, suddenly I'm not dropping my head forwards and not creating a lot of pressure on this area where I have my neck hump, phones upright, I can look at the phone this way, I'll create less pressure on the neck, and all the exercise that you do during the day, suddenly bare fruit, because you're taking away irritation throughout the day. So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure",

I'm probably not telling you anything new, if I say that these little gadgets here play a big part in the creation of the neck hump and the doubt is hump. I'm probably just average, I spend an average of two hours 30 minutes per day looking at my phone. I just need to go outside, go to your local supermarket, just go outside and you see the majority of people looking at the phones this way with a head tilting forwards. Now you can do all the exercises in the world, but if you keep on looking at your phone with your head drop down, no way you're going to get rid of that hump for good. So what we need to do is next to the exercise, you need to find a way to look at your phone that places less pressure on your neck, and I've got the right hack for you. All you need to do, super simple, all you need to do is support the arm that holds your phone with the other hand to look.

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck. So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

And while I want to just say this bread, it often is a sign of sleep apnea, and sleep apnea is not to be taken lightly. I mean, it can lead to a lot of medical issues. Right, I've heard people say, I'm not willing to accept this personally yet, but if I ever need one, because I don't want to be hooked up to a thing, but I know many people say, once they got a CPAP, they realized how much sleep they were missing.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

And you turn, left, and right. And you're definitely going to feel on here a bit of crunching when you're doing this. If it doesn't hurt, don't worry about it. It's good, it loosens tissue off. So that's actually fine. So really pull your arms up as high as possible you can and turn your head to the left and the right. You do this for about 10, 20, 30 seconds, but it's important that you try to do this throughout the day and it will help you and support the other exercise you're doing in the evening.

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

      "answer": "To reduce neck pressure while using your cell phone, it is essential to avoid dropping your head down. Instead, you should find a more ergonomic position to hold your phone. The video suggests that maintaining a neutral spine and keeping your head aligned with your body can help alleviate strain on your neck. This adjustment is crucial because consistently looking down can contribute to the development of a neck hump and other postural issues [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 07:20-07:23].\n\nAdditionally, incorporating exercises throughout the day can support better posture and neck health. While the video emphasizes the importance of exercises, it also highlights that how you position your phone is equally vital in preventing neck strain [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 06:23-06:30]. \n\nIn summary, to minimize neck pressure while using your cell phone, maintain a neutral head position and consider integrating posture-supporting exercises into your routine. This approach can help prevent long-term neck issues associated with poor phone usage habits.",
