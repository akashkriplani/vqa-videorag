          "text": "I'm Lisa Hollister, the director of trauma and acute care surgery for part few health. Today I'm going to show you how to stop the blade. Stop the blade is very simple. Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins.

Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done!

      "answer": "To apply pressure on a wound effectively, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Pressure**: When you encounter a bleeding patient, the first step is to apply direct pressure to the wound. Use your hands or a clean cloth to press firmly on the area. This helps to control the bleeding by compressing the blood vessels at the site of the injury. It is crucial to maintain this pressure consistently until bleeding is controlled or further help arrives [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38].\n\n2. **Assess the Situation**: If the bleeding does not stop with direct pressure, you may need to move to the next step of wound management, which involves packing the wound with gauze. This is done by taking gauze and packing it tightly into the wound to help absorb blood and apply pressure internally [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 01:12-01:17].\n\n3. **Safety Considerations**: Always ensure that your hands are clean or wear gloves if available to prevent infection. If the bleeding is severe, be aware that it can lead to shock, which is a life-threatening condition. Monitor the patient's responsiveness and breathing throughout",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

This is crucial before moving to packing the wound [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38].\n\n2. **Prepare the Gauze**: If bleeding continues despite pressure, prepare to pack the wound. You can use hemostatic gauze, standard gauze, or even a clean shirt if no gauze is available [Video 2: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 01:12-01:17].\n\n3. **Pack the Wound**: Take the gauze and gently pack it into the wound. Continue to pack until you cannot fit any more gauze inside. This step is essential to reach the source of the bleeding and effectively control it [Video 2].\n\n4. **Monitor for Additional Bleeding**: After packing, keep an eye on the wound for any further bleeding. If bleeding persists, additional measures, such as applying a tourniquet, may be necessary [Video 1].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always ensure that your hands are clean or wear gloves",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it.

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Let's start off with the first thing you want to do is you actually with most of these crutches now They have a little push pin here And there's actually some numbers along here like this for example goes all the way from five one to five nine So it's a good starting point if you're five nine Go ahead and set it up at five nine That's the push the buttons in it's a telescoping needle where and I was like the turret just a little bit and then you can slide that up and down But you gotta get those holes lined up so they click and the button pops out just like that. And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right?

This is the first step in managing a wound [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 00:34-00:38].\n\n2. **Wound Packing**: If bleeding persists despite applying pressure, proceed to pack the wound. Use hemostatic gauze if available, but any clean gauze or even a shirt can be used in emergencies. Take the gauze and firmly pack it into the wound until you cannot pack it any further. This step is crucial as it helps to reach the source of the bleeding and provides necessary pressure to control it [Video 1: wkF8OwsyNNQ, Time: 01:12-01:17].\n\n3. **Considerations**: Ensure that the gauze is packed tightly but not so much that it causes additional injury to the surrounding tissue. If the bleeding does not stop after packing, further medical intervention may be necessary, such as applying a tourniquet if appropriate.\n\nThese steps are essential for managing severe bleeding and should be performed as quickly as possible while awaiting professional medical help",

And as you exhale, start rolling forward so that you're drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Just notice that soreness, gosh, wow, we carry so much in that region, don't we? let's take it now to the rear. And so to the front and to the back you do it maybe about 30 to 45 seconds. Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully. And again, inhale up, exhale it down, just one more, inhale up, exhale it out. Just notice very quickly the body responds, so quick and effective ways just to get rid of that tension and stress on the shoulders.",

Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

You don't have to, you can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate back and forth, give the muscle a little time to relax and reset. And then the last one is going to be an upper trap stretch, which is the big muscle over all of those. And that's another one that holds a lot of stress and tightness and stiffness. And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fist and kind of push downwards, but again this is to hold that shoulder down to get the best stretch. You don't have to do this part, but it's really going to get a better stretch because then when you go into the stretch your shoulders not going to come up.

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers.

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

Ensure your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed. This position helps facilitate movement and reduces additional strain on your shoulders [Video 1: CvW-Zq3NlkU, Time: 00:27-00:33].\n\n2. **Shoulder Rolls**: Bring your fingertips to your shoulders. Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, start rolling your shoulders forward. Imagine drawing invisible circles with your elbows. This motion helps to release tension built up in the shoulder area [Video 1: CvW-Zq3NlkU, Time: 00:27-00:33].\n\n3. **Stretching**: After a few rolls, you can incorporate a levator scapula stretch. This targets the muscles around the shoulder blade and neck, which often hold significant tension. Gently tilt your head to one side, bringing your ear towards your shoulder, and hold for a few seconds to feel the stretch [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 06:51-06:54].\n\n**Safety Note**",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins.

Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood",

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check out my other videos to see how you can get rid of the pain and get back to doing what you want.",

Assess the peripheral veins for any previous attempts at venipuncture, which may indicate difficulty [Video 2: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 02:31-02:36].\n\n2. **Select the Tourniquet**: Use a pressure cuff or a standard tourniquet. If using a pressure cuff, set it to approximately 90 mmHg, which is just below the diastolic pressure. This will help engorge the veins, making them larger and easier to see [Video 3: 7lGE4OH0uJw, Time: 03:24-03:26].\n\n3. **Apply the Tourniquet**: Place the tourniquet about 4-6 inches above the intended venipuncture site. Ensure it is snug but not too tight to cause discomfort or compromise circulation.\n\n4. **Observe for Vein Distension**: After a minute, check for vein distension. The veins should appear larger and more prominent, facilitating easier",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in.

To practice drawing arterial blood with the venapukshar trainer, do the following. Fill a ten milliliter syringe with fake blood and connect to the smaller vein and let it run through the tube. Now tightly occlude one side of the smaller vein. Ask a person to sit opposite from you and have them press down on the plunger of the syringe with moderate pulsating pressure to simulate the pulsations of an artery. Perform the simulation procedure for drawing arterial blood.",

And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also",

On the start of your operating day in the morning, your first patient is in the operating room eight and it comes with the 10 to 15 minutes delay. As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll.

Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins.

Yes, which you're going to find out how useful this can be for after surgery as well as before surgery. So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with",

Address any anxiety, as a frightened patient may have increased sympathetic outflow, making veins harder to visualize [Video 1: 03:24-03:26].\n\n2. **Application of the Esmarch Bandage**: Use an Esmarch bandage and apply it tightly around the limb, starting from the distal end and moving proximally. The tightness of the bandage is crucial; it should be applied with sufficient pressure to occlude venous return but not arterial flow. The effectiveness of this technique is proportional to how well the bandage is applied [Video 1: 07:39-07:44].\n\n3. **Setting Pressure**: If using a pressure cuff, set it to around 90 mmHg or just below the diastolic pressure to enhance vein visibility [Video 1: 03:24-03:26].\n\n4. **Observation**: After applying the bandage, observe the dorsal and volar sides of the wrist and hand for prominent veins, which should become more visible due to the engorgement of the veins from the",

          "text": "In this video, I'm going to show you how to reset forward rounded shoulders with a move that you probably haven't seen before. Stay tuned. Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands or I should say your arms. And you're going to, again, put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame. Just like this. Put your feet together. And then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. So with this, it should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those peck muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region. Those are the rhomboids where the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by",

And as you exhale, start rolling forward so that you're drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Just notice that soreness, gosh, wow, we carry so much in that region, don't we? let's take it now to the rear. And so to the front and to the back you do it maybe about 30 to 45 seconds. Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully.

The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

I'd have them do this and they go oh that kind of hurts It just doesn't feel that good. Yep. So then we would go to the towel and And they would take it home, they'd use the towel for a couple of days and they come back. And by then they were almost ready to do it without the towel then. Yeah, even no towel pain with the towel, less pain, more range of motion. But still not all the way, you know, we're looking for full extension. Our end goal is that you can do it without the towel and you have full motion. That's your end goal. However you get there. You might use a mix of of towel and no towel But you can use your hands kind of like this. Your hands sometimes work too. Yeah, little tricks tricks that we'll show you And then we're gonna go on to the last one is just for the rotation now. This was a little tricky It is you can actually rotate right till left and just give a little over pressure on your jaw Always really get lost on these by the way. Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck.",

So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow into your side. That's not a bad thing, but we can make it better if we get the towel and maybe kind of ball it up a little bit fatter. You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

This exercise is not suitable for individuals with shoulder instability or those who have undergone shoulder surgeries, including rotator cuff issues [Video 2: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 01:21-01:27].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Stand in the doorway and hold a towel behind your back. The towel should be positioned so that it helps you pull your shoulders back gently.\n\n3. **Stretching**: Place your arms against the doorframe at shoulder height. Lean forward slightly, allowing your chest to stretch while keeping your shoulders back. This targets the tight chest (pectoral) muscles and the rhomboids, which are often responsible for rounded shoulders [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 04:10-04:15].\n\n4. **Duration**: Hold this position for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply to enhance the stretch. Repeat this stretch several times throughout the day to maintain proper shoulder alignment [Video 1].\n\nRemember, if you experience any pain during this",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands or I should say your arms. And you're going to, again, put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame. Just like this. Put your feet together. And then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. So with this, it should feel like a very good stretch in the front with those peck muscles, but also you should feel a stretch in the mid-back region. Those are the rhomboids where the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by",

And as you exhale, start rolling forward so that you're drawing invisible circles with your elbows. Just notice that soreness, gosh, wow, we carry so much in that region, don't we? let's take it now to the rear. And so to the front and to the back you do it maybe about 30 to 45 seconds. Breathing as you go of course, good slowly bringing it down. The breath is so important. Just bringing your attention to your breath in and of itself can be helpful. Let's do one more thing. Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully. And again, inhale up, exhale it down, just one more, inhale up, exhale it out. Just notice very quickly the body responds, so quick and effective ways just to get rid of that tension and stress on the shoulders.",

You should start to feel the shoulder, start to go posterior or backwards and get a good stretch into the shoulder. Only go to your comfort level. Once you hit that, this is going to be the next part. Take your body weight and then lunge into it very, very slowly to intensify the stretch, and I'm telling you right now, this feels really good into the shoulder. I hold it to my comfort level for 15 to 30 seconds, I'm going to then relax, and then do three to five repetitions. With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next",

My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

With this one, you might feel a pop or a cracks sensation or self-release into the shoulder capsule, because if that shoulder is locked and drawn forward with that posterior movement, it's going to free it and kind of reset that ball in socket joint. Whatever you do, don't try to use your body weight to really like lunge into it and force that release. You can actually cause more irritation. So if it pops or cracks through the natural motion of the shoulder, that's completely normal, don't try to force it. So with this next part, we're going to focus on two big instigators of rounded shoulders that is tight chest or peck muscles and also the rhomboids. So what we're going to do is hit them both at the same time with this stretch. It's literally one of my favorite stretches. I do it all the time throughout the day. You go back to the door frame. You're going to take your hands or I should say your arms. And you're going to, again, put your triceps at about parallel with the floor. Place them directly against the door frame. Just like this. Put your feet together. And then you're just going to use your body weight to lean into the door frame. So with this, it should feel like a very",

Ensure you have enough space to stretch your arms comfortably without obstruction.\n\n2. **Arm Placement**: Raise your arms to shoulder height and place your forearms against the doorframe, with your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. This position targets the chest and rhomboid muscles, which are often tight in individuals with rounded shoulders [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 04:10-04:15].\n\n3. **Lean Forward**: Gently lean your body forward through the doorway. You should feel a stretch across your chest and the front of your shoulders. Hold this position for about 15-30 seconds to allow the muscles to relax and lengthen.\n\n4. **Repeat**: You can perform this stretch multiple times throughout the day to help alleviate tightness and improve your posture [Video 1: tr7JKUxwqwA, Time: 01:21-01:27].\n\n**Safety Considerations**: This exercise is not recommended for individuals with shoulder instability, recent shoulder surgeries, or significant rotator cuff issues.",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

      "answer": "To improve blood flow and treat varicose veins by raising your legs, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by lying down on your back. Elevate your legs above the level of your heart. You can use pillows or a wedge to support your legs comfortably. This position helps facilitate venous return by using gravity to assist blood flow back to the heart [Video 2: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 00:41-00:47].\n\n2. **Leg Exercises**: While your legs are elevated, perform simple exercises. One effective exercise is the straight leg raise. With your legs straight, lift them slightly off the ground and hold this position for a few seconds. This action engages the muscles in your legs, which can help pump blood back towards the heart [Video 3: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n3. **Toe Flexing**: Additionally, flex your toes towards you while your legs are elevated. This movement can further assist in improving circulation and reducing the pooling of blood in the veins [Video 3: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01",

This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back. So bring your both feet up and then just do a circular motion like this. Just starting off maybe 30 seconds, that might make you a little tired and then you can come down and relax. You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you",

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins.

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it.

You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises.

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

          "text": "Hey everybody, it's Dr. Joe. Today, I'm going to show you some exercises to help with vericose fanes. Let's get started. Disclaimer work. Disclaimer work. So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

      "answer": "To improve blood flow and treat varicose veins through a bicycle leg exercise, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Begin by lying on your back. You can prop one leg up if it helps you maintain balance and comfort [Video 1: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 01:18-01:24].\n\n2. **Leg Movement**: Straighten one leg out in front of you. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten the leg further. This position engages the muscles effectively [Video 1].\n\n3. **Bicycle Motion**: Perform a cycling motion with your legs. This mimics the pedaling action of a bicycle, which can help stimulate blood flow in the lower extremities.\n\n4. **Hold at the Top**: When your leg is fully extended, hold it at the top of the movement for a moment. This pause can enhance venous return by utilizing gravity to assist blood flow back towards the heart [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repetition**: Repeat this exercise for several sets, ensuring to alternate legs to promote balanced circulation.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise regimen, especially if you have existing",

So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So just start off with 10 of those coming up nice and slow holding it there, 5 to 10 seconds, letting that blood flow come back down, working those muscles and then slowly coming back down. If 10 becomes easy then you can work your way up to 15, 20, 25. The next one, just bring both legs up with your knees propped up and then you're going to go into a bicycle position movement on your back.

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

      "answer": "To improve blood flow and help treat varicose veins, performing calf raises or heel raises can be beneficial. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Ensure you have a stable surface nearby for support if needed.\n\n2. **Calf Raise Execution**: Slowly rise onto your toes, lifting your heels off the ground. Hold this position for 5 to 10 seconds to allow blood to flow back down through the veins [Video 2: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 02:06-02:12].\n\n3. **Controlled Descent**: Gradually lower your heels back to the ground. This controlled movement helps engage the calf muscles effectively while promoting venous return.\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Start with 10 repetitions. If this becomes easy, gradually increase to 15, 20, or even 25 repetitions to enhance muscle engagement and blood flow [Video 2: G_AzQnDFaBU, Time: 02:06-02:12].\n\n5. **Alternative Movement**: If you find the calf raises uncomfortable, consider a stair-stepper-like motion, pushing up and down",

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients.

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time.

Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood",

Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position.

Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds.

The folks at MD sent it to me to wear today, and if you're interested in purchasing one, click on the link up there. So let's get on to the next stiffness. This, my favorite exercise or stretch for next stiffness is a chin tuck. chin tucks are easy to do, you can do them anywhere and they really help reset all the muscles in your neck. So if you've got some tightness, if you've got some stiffness, this is a great one. So chin tucks aren't tucking down, but you're actually tucking your chin in. So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have",

So again, you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations. But if you can get it right, you're really gonna get that stiffness out of there. So it works really, really well. So the next one is gonna just be a levator scapula stretch. And that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause",

So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel to help stretch your neck and get that stiffness and tightness out. This is called Snacks. It's a particular technique. It stands for something really long. But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning, then I'm getting that extra stretch in there",

Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

      "answer": "To perform chin tucks for neck stiffness, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Start by sitting or standing comfortably with a straight posture. Ensure your shoulders are relaxed.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck Position**: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest. Imagine creating a double chin without tilting your head down. This movement helps to realign your cervical spine and reduce stiffness.\n\n3. **Use of Towel**: For added support, you can use a towel. Place it behind your neck to stabilize your spine while you perform the chin tuck. This will help you maintain proper alignment during the exercise [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:39-03:41].\n\n4. **Hold the Position**: Maintain the chin tuck position for about 30 seconds. It is recommended to perform this exercise three times on each side, a couple of times a day for optimal results [Video 2].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure you do not overextend your neck or apply excessive force. If you experience pain, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.\n\nIncorporating these chin tucks into your routine can help alleviate neck stiffness effectively.",

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into.

So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel to help stretch your neck and get that stiffness and tightness out. This is called Snacks. It's a particular technique. It stands for something really long. But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning, then I'm getting that extra stretch in there to get that tightness out. So with this one, the snag, what you're going to do is you're going to grab the towel with your opposite hand here and you're going to stabilize that towel right there, hold it in one spot. So that holds the vertebrae there so you can get the stretch a little bit higher. Then you're going to grab the other hand, make sure you're not choking yourself, but bring it up up and over your ear. So this time you're gonna kind of pull up and over. So you're not just pulling a cross. That's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull.",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

So the key is to keep your chin in the neutral position, so you're not tucking in like this and you're not tucking in like this, but you're keeping it neutral right there and you're just tucking it in that way. So you're moving your head back, you know, lots of little chins right there. And you wanna hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax. Just doing about five of those. If you wanna use your finger there as a little target, I like that sometimes because it shows that you're making progress. Just leave your finger in one spot, tuck it in, hold that for about three to five seconds. And then when you relax, you should have a little bit of space in between. That just means it's resetting those muscles, getting that head back into a neutral position, getting some of that stiffness out there. So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel to help stretch your neck and get that stiffness and tightness out. This is called Snacks. It's a particular technique. It stands for something really long. But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning, then I'm getting that extra stretch in there",

You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time, but after a couple days or so and sometimes less, if you use a towel, no, this is a tricky part.

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

      "answer": "To alleviate neck stiffness using a towel, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the Towel**: Roll a towel into a cylindrical shape. This will be used to provide support and assist in movement.\n\n2. **Chin Tucks**: Begin by tucking your chin down gently while holding the towel behind your neck. This helps to stabilize the cervical spine and reset the neck position. Hold the tuck for about three to five seconds, repeating this five times. Aim to do this a couple of times a day [Video 2: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 01:44-01:46].\n\n3. **Use the Towel for SNAGs**: Position the rolled towel at the base of your skull. Gently pull the towel to create a slight traction while maintaining the chin tuck. This technique helps in mobilizing each segment of the spine and relieving stiffness. Perform this on each side, ideally three times for 30 seconds [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:39-03:41].\n\n4. **Monitor Your Response**: If you experience increased pain or discomfort while performing these exercises, stop immediately. It's crucial to only continue",

You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into. So I'm doing like that to get that segment stabilized and and then I'm tucking in my chin and going back into extension. So you can see it's that",

The next one, I really like, is using a towel to help stretch your neck and get that stiffness and tightness out. This is called Snacks. It's a particular technique. It stands for something really long. But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning, then I'm getting that extra stretch in there to get that tightness out. So with this one, the snag, what you're going to do is you're going to grab the towel with your opposite hand here and you're going to stabilize that towel right there, hold it in one spot. So that holds the vertebrae there so you can get the stretch a little bit higher. Then you're going to grab the other hand, make sure you're not choking yourself, but bring it up up and over your ear. So this time you're gonna kind of pull up and over. So you're not just pulling a cross. That's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull.",

If you don't have time for three, you can do two on each side, but the best is doing it three times on each side for 30 seconds a couple times a day. So you can also use the towel for some chin tucks and then some movement. So once you get the chin tucked down, that what the towel does is again, each segment of your spine. If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it.

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

If you wanna kind of stabilize this one with the towel, then you're moving the other one. So it's almost like a mobilization kind of movement. And sometimes this is really good to do to help get that stiffness and tightness out there. It's sometimes hard to do on your own, but the towel really helps you do it. This is what if you're getting manual work done by a therapist, they would kind of hold one spot with one hand to do it with the other, but you can't really do that yourself. So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into.

So I really, really like that. And again, hold it three to five seconds. Just do them about five times, a couple times a day. The next one, I really like, is using a towel to help stretch your neck and get that stiffness and tightness out. This is called Snacks. It's a particular technique. It stands for something really long. But what I like to do is use the towel because a lot of times the towel can help hold the segments So like if I'm holding here and turning, then I'm getting that extra stretch in there to get that tightness out. So with this one, the snag, what you're going to do is you're going to grab the towel with your opposite hand here and you're going to stabilize that towel right there, hold it in one spot. So that holds the vertebrae there so you can get the stretch a little bit higher. Then you're going to grab the other hand, make sure you're not choking yourself, but bring it up up and over your ear. So this time you're gonna kind of pull up and over. So you're not just pulling a cross. That's going into choking yourself a little bit, but up and over. But if you hold the towel kind of right over your ear, you get a good pull.",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way.

This will be used to support your neck during the exercise [Video 1: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Sit comfortably in a chair with your back straight. Place the rolled towel behind your neck, ensuring it provides support without causing discomfort.\n\n3. **Chin Tucks**: Begin by tucking your chin down towards your chest. This helps to stabilize your neck and spine [Video 3: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:39-03:41].\n\n4. **Neck Turns**: While maintaining the chin tuck, gently turn your head to one side, holding the position for about 30 seconds. Return to the center and repeat on the other side. Aim to do this three times on each side [Video 3].\n\n5. **Frequency**: Perform these exercises a couple of times a day for best results.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience any increase in pain or discomfort during the exercise, stop immediately.",

And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

That's a trying to determine which direction feels the best and the other thing I hope it's okay I recommend this Brad. The idea is that you do these once a day. The idea is you do these throughout the day and that's why we usually pick one and usually why it only wants to take 30 seconds. You take 30 seconds out of your day and do the stretch real quick and then move on and you're going to have better results by spreading out over the day instead of doing one long workout or stretch. And that goes for a lot of our stretches. But sure, I'll post your stretches. Yeah. So shall we carry on, Bob? Sure.

Do this 20 to 30 reps on each direction and also repeat it three to four sets, owner and radial distractions. Grab the end of the wrist with the other hand and slightly pull the wrist joint apart. This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury. Or another one, such as a couple tunnels in drone, passive, risk flexion and extension. To stretch through risk flexors, point your fingers up in your elbows, extend it nice and straight. Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors. Make sure your arm is nice and straight and your elbow is locked out. This is a great way to mobilize and",

Ensure your shoulders are relaxed.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck**: Begin with a chin tuck. Gently pull your chin towards your chest, which helps to elongate the neck and prepare for the stretch. This movement may create a slight pop or adjustment in your neck, which is normal as long as it is not painful [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 06:20-06:22].\n\n3. **Neck Rotation**: After the chin tuck, slowly turn your head to one side, aiming to look over your shoulder. Hold this position for a few seconds to feel the stretch along the side of your neck.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Return to the center and repeat the rotation on the opposite side. This continuous movement helps mobilize the neck and alleviate stiffness [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 06:51-06:54].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that the stretches are performed gently and without pain.

You don't have to, you can do them all on one side, all on the other side, but I feel like when you alternate back and forth, give the muscle a little time to relax and reset. And then the last one is going to be an upper trap stretch, which is the big muscle over all of those. And that's another one that holds a lot of stress and tightness and stiffness. And since it's so big up there, when it's tight, your neck can be really, really stiff. So this time what you want to do is the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of sit on the hand. And if that's uncomfortable to sit on it, you can just take your fist and kind of push downwards, but again this is to hold that shoulder down to get the best stretch. You don't have to do this part, but it's really going to get a better stretch because then when you go into the stretch your shoulders not going to come up.

And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness.

So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on.

      "answer": "To alleviate neck stiffness using upper trap stretches, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Sit or stand comfortably. Begin by placing one hand behind your head, ensuring your elbow is elevated. This position helps stabilize your neck during the stretch.\n\n2. **Stretching**: With your other hand, gently pull down on the elbow of the arm behind your head, directing your head towards the opposite side. Aim for a stretch that is not straight down but at a slight angle towards the opposite knee, approximately at a 45-degree angle. This technique targets the upper trapezius effectively [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 08:06-08:08].\n\n3. **Duration**: Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds. It\u2019s beneficial to alternate sides to ensure both upper traps are stretched evenly. You can perform this stretch a couple of times a day for optimal results [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 08:32-08:37].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure you do not force the stretch; it should feel comfortable and not painful. If you experience any discomfort, ease off the stretch. Always consult with a healthcare",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this.

Try taking a hot shower since the steam of water can help massage your neck and relax your muscles. If your pain persists, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxin. See a doctor if the cricking your neck doesn't go away after two to three days.",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch.

So there's a lot of different ways you can do this, but I like this one where you're basically arch up the middle back, but I like to bring the head down to the same time. Stretching all the muscles.

Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

This area is often associated with tension headaches, making it important to address. You can massage this region by applying gentle pressure and moving your fingers in small circles. This technique helps alleviate stiffness and discomfort [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 02:45-02:49]. Additionally, incorporating gentle movements such as slowly rocking your head from side to side or rolling it in circles can also help release tension and work out knots [Video 3: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29]. Remember to stop if you experience any pain during these movements.",

So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives it a little support and is helpful. So a chin-tuck here, a little support at the base of the neck, not up here. The reason I like the straps sometimes is because you actually can get to different levels of the neck. to get real specific. I also, you know, there's a way of doing the tall down here. You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too. And again, different levels of the neck. And you're going to go by how it feels if it feels better up here, go ahead. If not, you can keep it here. I've seen it work, well,",

So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand. Going to proceed with caution on these, probably going to want to do maybe more of a McKenzie technique, MCK, ENZIE, we got some videos on that and that works really well. You can try these with it, but only proceed if they aren't going to hay a Brad. Wow. You can try these with that arm pain and done this tingling, but only continue if it improves. If it gets worse, stop. All right. Now we're going to the towel, right Brad? Oh, yes, the towel. So you take a towel roll like this. You know, you could use a strap or a belt. Bob's going to use a strap there, a stretch-out strap. If you're using a belt, a thinner one, typically works a little bit better. And now we're going to start out. You can do chin-tucks with all this, but I think when you use it, it kind of gives",

So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it.

So now I'm kind of stabilizing with this side. I'm tucking in my chin, and then I'm using that towel just to help get that little bit of a turn. Little paws come back in and relax and reset myself. So again, you have to work a little bit at this to get the movement sometimes it's hard to do all those combinations. But if you can get it right, you're really gonna get that stiffness out of there. So it works really, really well. So the next one is gonna just be a levator scapula stretch. And that's those muscles that come down to that shoulder blade and then all the way up in your neck. Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there.

You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time, but after a couple days or so and sometimes less, if you use a towel, no, this is a tricky part.

So for this one, you're just going to kind of get that towel in the spot right here and then you're going to do a chin tuck and then a little bit of an extension with your neck while you're doing it. So this is a combination move. What I want to do with the towel is kind of push it down and forward. That's the motion that I want to push it into. So I'm doing like that to get that segment stabilized and and then I'm tucking in my chin and going back into extension. So you can see it's that combination moves sometimes it's hard to get down. This one you don't have to hold as long. You can just do it a smooth continuous motion, but if you wanna hold the movement for a little bit, you can hold that three to five. But sometimes this one is since it's a little bit more complicated, it's either easier just to do kind of that smooth motion without holding. So I'm going pushing down now, Going into that chin tuck, looking up, coming back in, and then releasing. So again, if I wanted to hold it, I'd do that chin tuck, look back, hold it for about three to five seconds, come back in and relax. If any of these are painful, don't do it. When you're mobilizing",

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using chin tucks and a towel or strap, you can incorporate a towel roll to enhance the effectiveness of the chin tuck exercise. Begin by rolling a towel and positioning it behind your neck. Perform the chin tuck by gently pulling your chin towards your chest, ensuring that your neck remains aligned with your spine. The towel helps stabilize the cervical spine, allowing for better engagement of the neck muscles during the exercise.\n\nIt is recommended to perform this exercise for about 30 seconds on each side, ideally three times a day, to maximize benefits. This method not only helps in reducing tension in the neck but also promotes proper spinal alignment and improves overall neck mobility [Video 3: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 03:39-03:41]. \n\nIn summary, using a towel roll during chin tucks can provide additional support and enhance the effectiveness of the exercise, contributing to relief from neck pain when performed consistently. Always ensure that the exercises do not exacerbate your symptoms; if they do, stop immediately [Video 1: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].",

You know, I should have mentioned earlier, but just relax, breathing, deep breathing is very helpful in this. If going to the right is painful, don't go that way. Just go to the left or vice versa, go the pain freeway. oftentimes that'll loosen up the painful way. Maybe not the first time, but after a couple days or so and sometimes less, if you use a towel, no, this is a tricky part.

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch.

These particular exercises in my and I think you'll agree in our opinion was going to cover a great majority of them and I have them in a specific order for a reason because I think particularly steps two and three you do the number two first and then three and they complement each other in that order.

Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this.

      "answer": "To relieve neck pain using neck rotation, it's important to incorporate gentle movements rather than avoiding them. Rotating your neck from side to side can help alleviate stiffness and discomfort. According to the video, you can perform this rotation by turning your head to the right and then to the left. This movement encourages flexibility and can reduce pain associated with a stiff neck [Video 2: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 07:00-07:05].\n\nAdditionally, the video emphasizes that avoiding movement can lead to increased stiffness and prolonged pain. When you refrain from moving your neck, you may inadvertently worsen your condition. Therefore, incorporating controlled neck rotations into your routine is beneficial for maintaining mobility and reducing discomfort [Video 3: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 00:41-00:43].\n\nIn summary, performing gentle neck rotations can help relieve pain and stiffness. It is crucial to maintain movement to prevent further complications. Always consult with a healthcare professional if pain persists or worsens.",

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden",

Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting.

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

So first of all, what is the rotator cap? The rotator cap is actually a collection of four muscles that serve to stabilize your shoulder joint Now that shoulder joint. It's a ball and socket joint. Here's the socket. Here's the ball It's actually the most mobile joint in the body We have the greatest range of motion available in three different planes of movement in our shoulder joint It's a very mobile joint, but then at the same time it needs to be a very stable joint. That's where that rotator cuff comes in. So again, what you're looking at here, this is my right shoulder blade. Looks just like that with the humorous, the arm bone hanging down right here. You've got four muscles that come off of your shoulder blade. Three of them come from the back, one of them comes from the front. And then you can see that they kind of wrap around the head of that humorous to form a cuff around it. Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade. It needs to be seated in the",

This allows for better visibility and access to the biceps.\n\n2. **Inspection**: Observe the biceps muscle for any asymmetry, swelling, or deformities. The biceps consists of both a long and short head, which should be noted during inspection [Video 1: t8AU9mWIsqI, Time: 00:39-00:41].\n\n3. **Palpation**: Gently palpate the biceps muscle. Start by locating the tendon of the long head, which runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicipital groove of the humerus. This tendon is crucial to examine as it is a common site for irritation and degeneration [Video 1].\n\n4. **Assessment**: While palpating, assess for tenderness, warmth, or any abnormal masses. These findings can indicate underlying issues such as tendinitis or tears.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure the patient is comfortable and relaxed to avoid muscle tension, which can hinder accurate palp",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

You can also alternate between a cold compress and a heating pad for 20 minutes each to reduce swelling and numb the pain. Try taking a hot shower since the steam of water can help massage your neck and relax your muscles. If your pain persists, take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxin. See a doctor if the cricking your neck doesn't go away after two to three days.",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee.

This helps in avoiding any skin irritation.\n\n3. **Wrap the Ice Pack**: If using a bag of frozen peas, you can place it directly on the skin. However, for safety, it is advisable to wrap the ice pack in a thin cloth or towel to prevent frostbite.\n\n4. **Apply the Ice Pack**: Position the wrapped ice pack over the swollen area. \n\n5. **Timing**: Keep the ice pack on the affected area for about 15-20 minutes. This duration is effective for reducing swelling and numbing pain.\n\n6. **Rest and Monitor**: After removal, allow the skin to return to normal temperature before reapplying. Monitor for any adverse reactions, such as excessive redness",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

In your dominant hand, take the syringe with exposed needle attached and hold it like a pencil, approach the skin at 30 to 45 degrees in line with the radial artery, pointing toward the elbow. The needle should enter the radial artery immediately below the gloved fingers of the non-dominant hand. Keep the skin taught and enter the skin with a brisk movement. Once in the soft tissue, gently advance the needle to where you think the radial artery is. It is easy to go straight through the radial artery if you rush, you may feel a slight give as the needle penetrates the wall of the radial artery. Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe. If you don't see blood, you have missed the artery and will have to withdraw the needle somewhat and then re-aign the syringe toward the pulsating artery. Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle.

Monitor the site and extremity for a while for any sign of circulatory problems, nerve damage, or any other complications. To practice drawing arterial blood with the venapukshar trainer, do the following. Fill a ten milliliter syringe with fake blood and connect to the smaller vein and let it run through the tube. Now tightly occlude one side of the smaller vein. Ask a person to sit opposite from you and have them press down on the plunger of the syringe with moderate pulsating pressure to simulate the pulsations of an artery. Perform the simulation procedure for drawing arterial blood.",

If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done!

Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in three dimensions. In your dominant hand, take the syringe with exposed needle attached and hold it like a pencil, approach the skin at 30 to 45 degrees in line with the radial artery, pointing toward the elbow. The needle should enter the radial artery immediately below the gloved fingers of the non-dominant hand. Keep the skin taught and enter the skin with a brisk movement. Once in the soft tissue, gently advance the needle to where you think the radial artery is. It is easy to go straight through the radial artery if you rush, you may feel a slight give as the needle penetrates the wall of the radial artery. Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe.",

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

A primed and ready-to-use lancing device which we did earlier. A column wall pad, a yellow sharp spin, and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test route from the vinyl and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point a warmer and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample.

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein, we have an immediate flashback and there you go. Another successful inch-alignus placement.",

Pat your skin dry with a clean towel [Video 3: 02:38-02:45].\n\n2. **Application of CHG Wipes**: After your skin is dry, take the CHG wipes and apply them directly to the cool, dry skin of your neck and chest. Make sure to cover the entire area as directed [Video 3: 02:38-02:45].\n\n3. **Air Drying**: Once you have applied the wipes, allow the area to air dry for one minute. It is normal for your skin to feel sticky for several minutes, but this sensation will dissipate as your skin dries [Video 2: 04:49-04:50].\n\n4. **Post-Application Care**: After your skin has dried completely, dress in clean clothes. Avoid using any powder, deodorant, or lotion on the treated areas to ensure the effectiveness of the wipes [Video 2: 04:49-04:50].\n\n5. **Disposal**:",

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few punctures that went on unsuccessfully. But the most important thing here is that the arm stays down, never elevated, because that would drain the blood from the upper extremity. You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with",

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

Make sure to cover the entire area as directed [Video 3: 02:45].\n\n3. **Drying Time**: After applying the wipes, allow the area to air dry for one minute. It is normal for your skin to feel sticky for several minutes; this sensation will dissipate as your skin dries [Video 2: 04:49-04:50].\n\n4. **Post-Application Care**: Once the skin is dry, dress in clean clothes.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully.

Do this 20 to 30 reps on each direction and also repeat it three to four sets, owner and radial distractions. Grab the end of the wrist with the other hand and slightly pull the wrist joint apart. This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive movements such as keyboard work, also known as RSI, aka repetitive strain injury. Or another one, such as a couple tunnels in drone, passive, risk flexion and extension. To stretch through risk flexors, point your fingers up in your elbows, extend it nice and straight. Now with the other hand, pull your stretching hands, fingers backwards towards your body. Make sure you have a nice and relaxed wrist to promote as much movement and stretching possible. Now to stretch the risk extensors, point your fingers downwards and pull the hand back towards your body. This will promote risk flexion, but we will stretch this risk extensors. Make sure your arm is nice and straight and your elbow is locked out. This is a great way to mobilize and",

You just go until you feel uncomfortable, stretch with that. You can also add in a little bit more pushing back to get the hip flexors as well if you want to. So if I'm stretching here and I pull that knee back just a little bit more, I'm gonna get those hip flexors stretching a little bit as well. So if you really wanna get a kind of a combination stretch, you can do that because that's a great area of stretch out if you're sitting up, no falling. If you're sitting a lot throughout the day, because those muscles are in a shortened position. So if you pull it back just a little bit, you're gonna get a combination stretch, which is really good as well. There's a whole bunch of different ways to stretch out your quad, you can do it lying down, you can do it lying on your side, on your stomach. You can use a strap to stretch it out, but if you're at work, and you don't really have equipment, this is the best way to stretch it out.

You want the arm to hang down or be horizontal at least, and then we apply that first round with the S mark bandage, which is for the turnicate purposes, and then we're going to squeeze the blood more distally so that the blood from the deep veins actually pulls down and fills up the small peripheral veins distally. So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best.

And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in. Okay, so here's another example, again, another patient who was brought to the operative area where you can see multiple attempts at venous puncture and ivy line that went on successfully. So we're going to then now proceed to the placement on the other side here, but you can also see a few",

It is important to avoid using any powders, deodorants, or lotions before the application of the wipes, as these can interfere with the cleaning process [Video 3: 02:38-02:45].\n\n2. **Wipe Application**: Use one wipe for each leg. Start with your right leg, beginning at the thigh and working your way down to the toes. Make sure to cover the entire circumference of your leg and foot to ensure thorough cleaning [Video 1: 03:50-03:56].\n\n3. **Repeat for the Other Leg**: After completing the right leg, use a separate wipe for your left leg, following the same technique from thigh to toes [Video 1: 03:50-03:56].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Avoid wiping over the genitals and sensitive areas to prevent irritation. The wipes are designed to help prevent infections, so proper application is crucial [Video 2: 01:50-01:56].\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively clean dry skin on",

So here we go stretch and apply. Stretch and apply and keep going circularly. For this we typically use an S mark bandage that's anywhere between 10 and 15 centimeters wide. We keep on going diligently because the diligence with which you apply this S mark bandage is directly proportional with the success you're going to get with this particular technique. As you could see we started seeing already some peripheral veins of the dosal on the wrist and the hand. But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side.

We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity.

The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein that is accessible now for a cannulation, something that previously we could not see. Now he's another very important trick that we always do is that is you want to bent that catheter, bent that needle because bending the needle allows you to lift the needle up slightly because the angle of insertion has to be very low as these are very pretty for veins. And here we go now the intravenous catheter is in.

Release the pressure. At the color does not return within 2 seconds, the bandage is too tight. If blood shows will addressing, don't remove it. Just apply a second bandage on top. If bloodshed through both dressings, remove them and apply a fresh bandage, ensuring they's direct pressure applied at the point of bleeding. Support the injured part with a sling or bandage. But check circulation every 10 minutes. Keep monitoring the casualties level of response while waiting for help to arrive. So remember, when treating severe bleeding, wear gloves if available.

It\u2019s important to avoid using any powders, deodorants, or lotions after the cleaning process, as they can interfere with the effectiveness of the wipes [Video 2: 04:49-04:50].\n\n2. **Application**: Begin by using one CHG wipe. Start at the upper back and wipe downwards, ensuring you cover the entire area thoroughly. Use a gentle motion to avoid irritation.\n\n3. **Wiping Technique**: Make sure to wipe in a manner that includes all folds and creases in the skin, as these areas can harbor bacteria. Although the video does not specify back folds, similar techniques are advised for other body parts, indicating thoroughness is key [Video 3: 03:50-03:56].\n\n4. **Drying**: After applying the wipe, allow the area to air dry for one minute. It is normal for the skin to feel sticky initially, but this sensation will dissipate as the skin dries [Video 2: 04:49-04:50].\n\n5. **Disposal",

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe but are now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. TIP FIVE! That's it. A yellow shark's been an out-one or two-ing diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips. How can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?",

      "answer": "To use mupirocin ointment for removing Staphylococcus aureus from the nose, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Nasal Swab Test**: Initially, a nasal swab test will be performed to confirm if you are colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. If positive, mupirocin will be prescribed as treatment [Video 1: 05:40-05:44].\n\n2. **Application Schedule**: Apply mupirocin ointment twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening) for five consecutive days. Additionally, apply it once more on the morning of any scheduled surgery [Video 1: 05:40-05:44].\n\n3. **Application Technique**: To apply the ointment, squeeze a small amount onto a clean fingertip or cotton swab. Gently insert the swab or fingertip into your nostril and apply a thin layer of the ointment inside the nostril. Repeat for the other nostril.\n\n4. **Safety Notes**: Ensure your hands are clean before and after applying the ointment. Avoid touching the tip of the ointment tube to your nose or any other surfaces to prevent contamination [Video 1].\n\nFollowing these instructions will help effectively",

Do not use ice, because it may further damage the injured skin. Avoid touching the wound with bare hands or unsteer alobjects. Avoid applying ghee, butter or any oil as it increases the chance of infection. Do not break blisters that may develop. If blisters break, clean the area by running tap water over it. Apply an over-the-counter antibiotic or a burn ointment. Leave the burn alone for 24 hours. Don't cover the burn and less clothing robes on it. If it shrubs, cover it with a gauze pad tape twell away from the burn. Move the dressing every day and clean the wound, cover it again. If the irritation and pain does not subside, do not hesitate to seek for medical help.",

We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

          "text": "Hi, I'm Dr. Jeff Dogus and today I'm going to show you how to unlock a locked jaw. First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

But the first thing I want to show is something simple you can do. If these muscles are tight, stiff, painful, a simple self massage. I'm going to show you how well this can work. Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere.",

Cold water helps reduce the skin's temperature and cleans the affected area, which is crucial for proper healing. It is important to avoid using ice, as it can cause further damage to the injured skin. Additionally, refrain from touching the wound with bare hands or unsterilized objects to prevent infection [Video 1: O1kiguGUt3o, Time: 00:50-00:52].\n\nIn summary, for a first-degree burn, immediately cool the area with cold water and avoid ice to prevent additional injury.

The heart start in trepid lets you perform manual defibrillation using multifunctiony electrode pads, external paddles, and internal paddles. Here, we'll demonstrate manual defibrillation using external paddles. After assessing your patient and determining that defibrillation is necessary, connecting the paddles cable to the device and applying the paddles to the patient's bare chest, set the therapy knob to the desired energy for the patient. Then, press the charge button on the paddle. The orange shock buttons on the paddles flash to indicate the defibrillator is charged, and the patient contact indicator lights turn green, once proper skin contact is made. Make sure no one is touching the patient, or anything connected to the patient. Press shock buttons simultaneously located on the paddles. Upon delivery of the shock, the heart start in trepid announces, shock delivered. Following successful defibrillation, the jewels delivered displays, and the shock counter will increment accordingly. Following successful defibrillation, and after you confirm a stable heart rhythm, return the therapy knob to monitor.",

Confirm that defibrillation is necessary before proceeding [Video 1: Dubih8EzBJQ, Time: 00:54-00:59].\n\n2. **Prepare the Equipment**: Gather the external paddles and ensure they are functioning properly. Check that the defibrillator is set to the appropriate energy level for the patient's condition.\n\n3. **Position the Paddles**: Place the paddles on the patient's chest. One paddle should be positioned on the right side of the sternum, and the other on the left side, below the axilla [Video 1].\n\n4. **Charge the Defibrillator**: Once the paddles are in place, charge the defibrillator to the required joules. Ensure that everyone is clear of the patient.\n\n5. **Deliver the Shock**: Press the discharge button to deliver the shock. After the shock, immediately reassess the patient's rhythm and pulse.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always ensure that no one is in",

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner.

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting. Move side to side for about 20 to 30 reps and repeat it for the five times. Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow stretch. To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards.

Ensure you have a stable surface to hold onto for balance if needed.\n\n2. **Bend One Knee**: Gently bend one knee and bring your heel towards your buttocks. This action engages your quadriceps.\n\n3. **Hold Your Ankle**: With the same-side hand, grasp your ankle or foot. If you feel tightness in your knee rather than the muscle, adjust the position by bringing your leg back slightly to target the quadriceps better, as they are all interconnected [Video 1: r21kAatSVqc, Time: 04:28-04:32].\n\n4. **Maintain a Neutral Spine**: Keep your back straight and avoid arching your lower back.

If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important.

And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is find a wine cork. Of course, I prefer the Buffalo TMJ Kick, the click corks, but you could really use any old wine cork for many old wine bottles. What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back and forth, side to side, front and back, and just play with it.

Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better. In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension.

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is",

What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back and forth, side to side, front and back, and just play with it. Let the muscles relax as you're doing this, and play with it as much as you want over the course of a day, as much as your muscles can tolerate. You don't want to push it too hard and you don't want the muscles to get sore. And of course you don't want to overwork or overstrain these compromised joints. Now even though I can't guarantee that this is going to work for you, I can tell you that it is possible and it's safe. I just had a patient last week who I set home with a cork and her jaw unlocked within a few days. The last thing that I want to say is I want to stress to you that even if your jaw unlocks, it's very, very likely that it's going to become locked again. When you clench in your back teeth, you're going to drive the condile behind the disc again and there's a good chance you'll get stuck there. And this will continue unless you take steps to correct the problem. So if",

I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings.

I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable",

Now even though I can't guarantee that this is going to work for you, I can tell you that it is possible and it's safe. I just had a patient last week who I set home with a cork and her jaw unlocked within a few days. The last thing that I want to say is I want to stress to you that even if your jaw unlocks, it's very, very likely that it's going to become locked again. When you clench in your back teeth, you're going to drive the condile behind the disc again and there's a good chance you'll get stuck there. And this will continue unless you take steps to correct the problem. So if you really want to protect your jaw joints and prevent them from becoming locked permanently, it's probably a good idea for you to visit a TMJ specialist or someone who is very knowledgeable about the anatomy and function of the temperament-dibular joints and get yourself an orthotic device.

This tool helps in assessing the maximum distance your jaw can open without forcing it [Video 2: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 02:23-02:26].\n\n2. **Position Yourself**: Stand in front of a mirror to observe your jaw movement. This allows you to see any deviations as you open your mouth [Video 3: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 05:51-05:55].\n\n3. **Open Your Jaw**: Gently open your mouth as wide as you can without forcing it. Pay attention to how your jaw moves. If it drifts to one side, this may indicate a joint problem on that side [Video 3: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 05:51-05:55].\n\n4. **Measure the Distance**: Use the cork to gauge the distance between your upper and lower teeth. The normal maximum opening is typically around 22 to 23 millimeters. If you find that your jaw cannot open",

In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension. He's also have a little ribbon attached to them so that you can tie them up over your head like so. Wonderful. I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles.

Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable",

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

          "text": "Hi, I'm Dr. Jeff Dogus and today I'm going to show you how to unlock a locked jaw. First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better. In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension.

An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing.

Now even though I can't guarantee that this is going to work for you, I can tell you that it is possible and it's safe. I just had a patient last week who I set home with a cork and her jaw unlocked within a few days. The last thing that I want to say is I want to stress to you that even if your jaw unlocks, it's very, very likely that it's going to become locked again. When you clench in your back teeth, you're going to drive the condile behind the disc again and there's a good chance you'll get stuck there. And this will continue unless you take steps to correct the problem. So if you really want to protect your jaw joints and prevent them from becoming locked permanently, it's probably a good idea for you to visit a TMJ specialist or someone who is very knowledgeable about the anatomy and function of the temperament-dibular joints and get yourself an orthotic device.

What I want you to do with the wine cork is place it in between your front teeth, the short way, where you can get to. And I want you to gently roll it back and forth, side to side, front and back, and just play with it. Let the muscles relax as you're doing this, and play with it as much as you want over the course of a day, as much as your muscles can tolerate. You don't want to push it too hard and you don't want the muscles to get sore. And of course you don't want to overwork or overstrain these compromised joints. Now even though I can't guarantee that this is going to work for you, I can tell you that it is possible and it's safe. I just had a patient last week who I set home with a cork and her jaw unlocked within a few days. The last thing that I want to say is I want to stress to you that even if your jaw unlocks, it's very, very likely that it's going to become locked again. When you clench in your back teeth, you're going to drive the condile behind the disc again and there's a good chance you'll get stuck there. And this will continue unless you take steps to correct the problem. So if",

      "answer": "To apply moist heat for reducing muscle tension in a locked jaw, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Before applying heat, measure how far your jaw can open. Use your fingers to measure from one finger up to the first knuckle, then to one bent knuckle, and finally to two fingers up. This baseline measurement will help you assess any improvement after treatment [Video 2: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:31-04:34].\n\n2. **Heat Application**: Use a corn bag or a similar moist heat source. Corn bags can be heated in the microwave and are effective for muscle relaxation. Ensure the bag is not too hot to avoid burns; it should be warm and comfortable against your skin [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 03:36-03:43].\n\n3. **Duration**: Apply the moist heat to the affected area for about 15-20 minutes. This duration is generally effective for muscle relaxation and tension relief.\n\n4. **Re-evaluation**: After the heat application, re-measure your jaw opening to see if there is any improvement in mobility [Video 2: SH-zKg26KCE, Time:",

If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you need to try to figure out what's causing your jaw to be locked. An easy trick is to know how far the jaw can open when it's a joint problem. Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation.

I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started.

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable",

First I think it's important that you understand why your jaw is locked and of course the best thing to do is to find a TMJ specialist in your area so you can get a proper diagnosis, but if you can't do this, there are a couple of quick tricks that you can try that might help you unlock your locked jaw. Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable opening without forcing it, and your jaw drifts over to the left, then it's most likely that you have a left joint problem. So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing.

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

      "answer": "To measure jaw opening using fingers, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Measurement**: Begin by placing one finger vertically into your mouth, ensuring it goes up to the first knuckle. This serves as your baseline measurement for jaw opening [Video 3: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 04:31-04:34].\n\n2. **Progressive Measurement**: Next, you can use a bent knuckle of one finger as a second measurement. This allows you to assess a slightly larger opening. Finally, you can use two fingers up to the first knuckle for a broader measurement of the jaw opening [Video 3].\n\n3. **Repeat Measurements**: It is advisable to take these measurements before and after any treatment, such as applying moist heat, to evaluate any changes in jaw mobility and comfort [Video 2: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 03:36-03:43].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure that you are gentle during the measurement process to avoid discomfort or injury. If you experience pain, it is recommended to stop and consult a healthcare professional.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively measure your jaw opening using your fingers.",

Usually that's around 22, 23 millimeters max. So if you have an acute internal arrangement or an articular problem, you can use a simple cork like the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork that's available now to measure that 23 millimeters. You use the short end of the cork and you see if you can open that wide. Now if you can get to that distance but you can't go any farther than that and it feels like a hard stop like your dead stuck right there, it's probably an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation. If you open to that distance of the cork at 23 millimeters and you could go a little farther than that and if you take it easy and relax and breathe, you can begin to open slowly a little further and a little further than you're probably dealing with a muscular problem. Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20",

Right off the bat, I want to give you a word of caution. It's a really bad idea to forceably manipulate a locked jaw. So if anybody wants to force your jaw open, whether you think they're an expert or not, do not let them do this because it will make the problem worse. I've personally watched and witnessed so-called chiropractic adjustments to the jaw. They were brutal, and I would not recommend them to anybody. If you visit a chiropractor, or a physical therapist, or massage therapist, who wants to do trigger point release, or myofascial therapy, using instruments or using manual manipulation, that's fine. All we're doing in that case is trying to loosen up tight muscles to get the jaw to be able to move more freely. That's okay. But the thought that you can forcibly manipulate a condile back on to a dislocated disc is ridiculous. It should never be done and I do not recommend it. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, let's get started. First, you",

I should remind you, it's important that you take a measurement before you apply moist heat so you know where you started. You can use your fingers to take these measurements and you start with one finger up to the first knuckle and then one bent knuckle and then two fingers up to the first knuckle And then two bent knuckles. And then finally, three fingers up to the first knuckle is considered to be maximum range of motion or reasonable range of motion for most human beings. Now, if you think your jaw is locked because you have an interarticular problem or a disc dislocation, then there are a couple things you could do to try to maneuver your jaw so that it'll open past the disc. This condition usually happens because we constantly chew and squeeze and force the condile of the mandible up into the socket and eventually it makes its way behind the articular disc, which slips forward and causes the jaw to feel stuck. So the first thing I want you to do before you try this is look in the mirror, open as wide as you're comfortable and see if your jaw goes off to one side or the other. Usually, if it's in our particular problem, the jaw will move in the direction of the problem or the affected joint. So if you open a little bit or open as far as you're comfortable",

So I'll use that as an example. Let's say I look in the mirror. My jaw opens, it drops down, and it moves a little bit to the left. And I also feel like it's stuck on that side and I feel tension over there. And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing. Now if you think that you have an intra-articular problem, meaning a disc dislocation on one or both sides, what I want you to do is",

And maybe I have a history of my job clicking on that side, but recently it's stopped clicking. So these are all clues that what you have is a disc dislocation that's not reducing.

Also, if you can't even open as wide as the cork, the width of a typical common wine cork, then you've definitely got a muscular problem, but you also might have an interarticular problem on top of it. This is where diagnostic imaging in particular MRI is very important. So if you feel like you have a muscular problem, the first thing you should do is apply moist heat for at least five minutes, preferably more like 20 minutes, and then measure your opening again and see if it feels any better. In my office, we use these corn bags, and I sell these to my patients, they're made locally by a very talented, craftswoman. And here I have my American flag independent stay corn bag in honor of the 4th of July that's coming up. They're filled with corn as the name would imply. So when you put them in a microwave for about a minute and a half to two minutes, they get quite warm and they stay warm for a long time and they generate a moist heat which is more penetrating than a dry heat would be and it's more effective at reducing muscle tension.

Typically, a normal jaw opening is around 22 to 23 millimeters. If your jaw can\u2019t open this wide, it may indicate an issue that needs addressing [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 02:23-02:26].\n\n2. **Use a Cork**: If you suspect an acute internal arrangement or articular problem, you can use a cork, such as the Buffalo TMJ kick the click cork. This cork is designed to help facilitate movement in the jaw [Video 1].\n\n3. **Gentle Application**: Carefully place the cork between your teeth and gently attempt to open your mouth. The cork should provide a slight resistance, encouraging the jaw to move without forcing it [Video 1].\n\n4. **Seek Professional Help**: While this method can be helpful, it's crucial to consult a TMJ specialist for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, especially if the problem persists [Video 1: SH-zKg26KCE, Time: 01:00-01:05].\n\n**Safety",

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what",

Yes, the mercenary has been know identified as a very important organ that may be involved in many things. So now we can see the gut brain access traffic by natural and so many things are improved if the vagus nerve is simulated. But it's good for decreasing risk of heart disease, increasing your lung capacity, bringing about self-regulation in the body in general. So just in class, there's yogic breathing, stimulate, see how it does. So now let me actually decide to tell you all the ways that you could probably simulate your biggest love to improve your well-being in general by augmenting self-regulation or what you call it homeostasis and therefore healing. The only response is nothing but a return to self-regulation.

This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event.

      "answer": "To stimulate the vagus nerve and potentially improve mental health, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Practice Deep Breathing**: Engage in slow, deep breathing exercises. Inhale deeply for a count of four, pause for one to two seconds, and then exhale for a count of six. This technique helps activate the vagus nerve and can promote relaxation [Video 1: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 10:33-10:43].\n\n2. **Incorporate Social Interactions**: Foster social connections that involve love, compassion, and empathy. Positive social exchanges can stimulate the vagus nerve, enhancing your emotional well-being [Video 1: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 10:33-10:43].\n\n3. **Exercise Regularly**: Engage in physical activities, as exercise is known to increase vagal tone. Activities like yoga, particularly poses such as cat-cow and sun salutation, can be beneficial [Video 2: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 11:37-11:45; Video 3: LK3dQdj8YWQ, Time: 09:19-09:",

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that you do diaphragmatic breathing and that's basically belly breathing. So instead of when you breathe in, you're not trying to expand your chest, you're trying to expand the diaphragm, which is in the belly. Right. So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that. And then you, a lot of times, they recommend perspreading, which is your blowing, it's like you're blowing out a candle. In some instances, they even say take your tongue and put it between the teeth and the front gums. And there's different eyes of the tongue right behind the, on the roof of",

Take a breath and bring your shoulders up as high as you can. Imagine all the stress you have. We're going to get rid of it. And exhale, let out forcefully.

Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter.

A little dose of sunlight. All these things will increase your bagel tone and improve your health overall health. As I said, our society is so much on sympathetic overdrive. We are constantly in the fight flight freeze response and we need to be more relaxed, more in the flow. and therefore increasing vagal tone is going to be helpful no matter what the situation. Somebody asked about bipolar. I don't know, but it'll certainly improve the mood in anyone if they improve their vagal tone. Okay, so I give you a lot of little suggestions. More next time and we can discuss how vagal tone influences things like not only mood, but influences addictive behavior by getting rid of cravings as well. Lots of interesting ways to increase vagal tone and improve well-being. Okay. So, um, um, try it, try it. Take care.",

Right? And and another thing with relaxation in I keto is like this really works, it could really make your stress level from here down here just by focusing on how you breathe and I can you can do these things in your car if you're stressed out on on the way to work or on the way home, you know, bad. That's where I usually do it Brad, I use it. I did this morning. Yeah. I know I was going to be meeting with you. And it's big stuff that things come down so. But you know, when I talk to people or anxious, I can see their breathing is rapid, right? And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that",

You just go until you feel uncomfortable, stretch with that. You can also add in a little bit more pushing back to get the hip flexors as well if you want to. So if I'm stretching here and I pull that knee back just a little bit more, I'm gonna get those hip flexors stretching a little bit as well. So if you really wanna get a kind of a combination stretch, you can do that because that's a great area of stretch out if you're sitting up, no falling. If you're sitting a lot throughout the day, because those muscles are in a shortened position. So if you pull it back just a little bit, you're gonna get a combination stretch, which is really good as well. There's a whole bunch of different ways to stretch out your quad, you can do it lying down, you can do it lying on your side, on your stomach. You can use a strap to stretch it out, but if you're at work, and you don't really have equipment, this is the best way to stretch it out.

There you go. Start it again. And then start it again. And you decide what length works for you. Brad and I were just discussing this. The next one's called 478. I always do a little variation of that. I'll hold it longer than they recommend and you said to you I hold a less than 7 seconds and this one you find the one that works for you again three seconds in hold three seconds out hold that real simple to do next one is four seven eight yeah this is my favorite this is the one I'll use at night sometimes or in the car in this one you breathe in for four hold for seven which is quite a good",

Right? And and another thing with relaxation in I keto is like this really works, it could really make your stress level from here down here just by focusing on how you breathe and I can you can do these things in your car if you're stressed out on on the way to work or on the way home, you know, bad. That's where I usually do it Brad, I use it. I did this morning. Yeah. I know I was going to be meeting with you. And it's big stuff that things come down so. But you know, when I talk to people or anxious, I can see their breathing is rapid, right? And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that",

Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

And it's big stuff that things come down so. But you know, when I talk to people or anxious, I can see their breathing is rapid, right? And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that you do diaphragmatic breathing and that's basically belly breathing. So instead of when you breathe in, you're not trying to expand your chest, you're trying to expand the diaphragm, which is in the belly. Right. So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that.

      "answer": "Box breathing is a structured breathing technique that can help manage anxiety and improve focus. To practice box breathing, visualize a box and divide your breathing into four equal parts, each representing one side of the box. You can choose the duration for each phase, commonly starting with four seconds for each part.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four seconds.\n2. Hold your breath for another count of four seconds.\n3. Exhale slowly through your mouth for four seconds.\n4. Hold your breath again for four seconds before repeating the cycle.\n\nThis method is particularly beneficial for individuals in high-stress situations, such as members of special forces, as it helps regulate anxiety levels and promotes calmness before critical tasks [Video 1: 2oXoiQfija4, Time: 04:25-04:31]. By focusing on your breath and maintaining a steady rhythm, box breathing can enhance mental clarity and emotional stability.",

Bob, before you go any further, I did want to interject my personal experience with breathing before, because we're given three systems of how to learn to breathe, but I started focusing on my breathing in my early 20s when I started the martial arts and they focus every classic, breathe in, breathe out, how important it is, right? Right? And and another thing with relaxation in I keto is like this really works, it could really make your stress level from here down here just by focusing on how you breathe and I can you can do these things in your car if you're stressed out on on the way to work or on the way home, you know, bad. That's where I usually do it Brad, I use it. I did this morning. Yeah. I know I was going to be meeting with you. And it's big stuff that things come down so. But you know, when I talk to people or anxious, I can see their breathing is rapid, right? And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down. It's shallow and higher. shallow and higher, yep, and it just leads right into the greater anxiety, exactly. With all these, what we're going to recommend is that",

So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right. And you want to need to find out which one of these works best for you. And maybe or even a little variation of one of these. But pick the time about what length you want to go. I can't recommend this enough red. I mean, it's just people get anxiety attacks and stuff like that. It's always the shallow breathing on them that you can see. All right, thanks. Good luck with it.

With all these, what we're going to recommend is that you do diaphragmatic breathing and that's basically belly breathing. So instead of when you breathe in, you're not trying to expand your chest, you're trying to expand the diaphragm, which is in the belly. Right. So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that. And then you, a lot of times, they recommend perspreading, which is your blowing, it's like you're blowing out a candle.

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what",

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

      "answer": "To perform the four, seven, eight breathing exercise, you will follow a specific sequence of inhalation, holding, and exhalation. Start by inhaling through your nose for a count of four seconds. Next, hold your breath for a count of seven seconds. Finally, exhale completely through your mouth for a count of eight seconds. This technique is designed to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety by regulating your breathing pattern.\n\nThe method emphasizes a longer exhalation compared to inhalation, which can help activate the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to a calming effect. While the provided video evidence does not detail the four, seven, eight breathing exercise specifically, it mentions a similar technique where one can breathe in for four seconds and exhale for eight seconds, indicating its popularity for anxiety reduction [Video 2: 2oXoiQfija4, Time: 05:39-05:45]. \n\nIn summary, while the specific four, seven, eight method isn't explicitly covered, the principles of controlled breathing for anxiety management are supported in the video.

Right? And and another thing with relaxation in I keto is like this really works, it could really make your stress level from here down here just by focusing on how you breathe and I can you can do these things in your car if you're stressed out on on the way to work or on the way home, you know, bad. That's where I usually do it Brad, I use it. I did this morning. Yeah. I know I was going to be meeting with you. And it's big stuff that things come down so. But you know, when I talk to people or anxious, I can see their breathing is rapid, right? And when I'm at night, when I'm sleeping in bed, and if I'm upset about something or anxious about something, I call my respirations and they're higher, right? You need to get them slowed down.

So instead of when you breathe in, you're not trying to expand your chest, you're trying to expand the diaphragm, which is in the belly. Right. So that means your belly extends out, which everyone doesn't like to do because it doesn't look, yeah, it's not attractive, yeah. And so you're breathing in through the nose and the belly is expanding while you're doing that. And then you, a lot of times, they recommend perspreading, which is your blowing, it's like you're blowing out a candle. In some instances, they even say take your tongue and put it between the teeth and the front gums. And there's different eyes of the tongue right behind the, on the roof of",

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what",

So what you're going to do is first you're going to inhale about a third of your lung capacity. So, and again, you're going to pick the time again. You can go to five seconds, seven seconds, nine seconds. Yeah, a third of your a capacity hold for five seconds, then inhale for up to two-thirds of your lung capacity, hold for five seconds, and then completely inhale, hold for five seconds, and then you're done. So with all these, you know, you've seen that you're doing some inhaling, you're doing some holding, and then you're breathing out. Right. And you want to need to find out which one of these works best for you. And maybe or even a little variation of one of these. But pick the time about what length you want to go. I can't recommend this enough red. I mean, it's just people get anxiety attacks and stuff like that. It's always the shallow breathing on them that you can see. All right, thanks. Good luck with it.

Like you can do anywhere from like three seconds all the way up to nine seconds for each side of the box. Right. So you're going to breathe in, inhale, let's take three seconds. Okay. And you do it, Brad. Okay. I'm going to be talking. Inhale for three seconds, hold for three seconds, one, two, three, exhale for three seconds, and then hold one more time for three seconds. There you go. Start it again. And then start it again. And you decide what length works for you. Brad and I were just discussing this. The next one's called 478. I always do a little variation of that. I'll hold it longer than they recommend and you said to you I hold a less than 7 seconds and this one you find the one that works for you again three seconds in hold three seconds out hold that real simple to do next one is four seven eight yeah this is my favorite this is the one I'll use at night sometimes or in the car in this one you breathe in for four hold for seven which is quite a good",

A benign mole generally has smooth and even borders as shown here. The borders of a melanoma, as shown here, may be uneven with scalloped, notched, or trailing edges. C stands for color variation. Most benign moles have one or two evenly distributed colors. Having a variety of colors, including brown, black, white, red, and or blue may be a feature of melanoma. D stands for diameter greater than half a centimeter. Although melanomas may be larger and diameter than the eraser head on your pencil, they may sometimes be smaller when first detected. The last letter E stands for evolution. In most cases, benign moles are stable over time. time. Be on alert when a mole starts to evolve or change in any way. When a mole is evolving, see a doctor. Any change in size, shape, color, texture, elevation, or any new symptom, such as bleeding, itching or scabbing, maybe a sign of malignancy. Thanks for watching!",

What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do right now is actually we're going to use, you can see there are a couple of attempts here, but we can use this highly elastic rubber bandage. And we're going to apply for a satanicate and slowly move that ternica towards the peripheral aspect of the extremity while squeezing the blood consistently towards the distal extremity. Here we go. We continue wrapping the extremity with stretch and apply stretch and apply stretch and apply until we get to the distal extremity. As we start assessing the digital peripheral veins, we start tapping on the skin. The tapping on the skin causes the vasodolation because of the release of the inflammatory mediators, the inflammatory mediators, then vasodolation, the peripheral veins here, we can clearly see every nice peripheral vein",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare and St. Joseph, Michigan. In today's world rounded forward shoulders are becoming a very big problem. Think just using cell phones, driving, new name at our posture is always leaning forward. That puts a lot of strain into the shoulder capsule and draws it forward or anterior. So what we're going to focus on is a really easy way to bring those shoulders back, reduce a lot of muscle tension in there and hopefully reset those shoulders and give you a lot of pain relief. The great part is, this does not require any special equipment, can be done pretty much anywhere at home at work, you name it. So let's get started with it. So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act",

The tendon of the long head runs from its insertion on the superglenoid tubercle of the scapula through the bicepital groove of the humorous. Examining the tendon is particularly important since it is a common sight for irritation and degenerative changes. For testing functionality of the tendon, inspect the biceps at rest and during contraction to detect any abnormalities. If the muscle belly is more distal, for example, a proximal rupture of the long head tendon should be suspected. Afterwards, palpate the tendon of the long head within the bicepital groove between the greater and minor tubercles. If the patient's arm is palpated while rotating the arm and out, the tendon should be detectable as it moves. Tenderness may be a sign of an inflammatory lesion or a degeneration of the tendon. A noticeable click suggests a sublication of the tendon.",

They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients. So here we have a patient in the upper room who is extremely cold, clammy extremities, and it's almost impossible to find a distal peripheral vein. So what we're going to do",

Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I can teach you on a video you have to do a couple of times to get the correct setting for yourself. Tip 3, this is what we call the pad of the finger. It has more nerve endings compared to the side. So for less pain, when using this, go for the sides and switch fingers regularly to prevent thickening of the skip. If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes.

But typically the best veins that you get with this technique or either on the dorsal side or the volal side. Here we can see quite a few of them now the volal side. And again we top the territory several times because that top you release is inflammatory mediators, we stabilise the skin, we stretch the skin and if any how possible we pick the vein that has two contributors because that's where the veins are fixed the best. Now the catheter enters into the vein, we have an immediate flashback and there you go. Another successful inch-alignus placement.",

A benign mole will have both halves that match when divided in the middle. If the two sides do not match, this asymmetry is a warning sign for melanoma [Video 1: hXYd0WRhzN4, Time: 01:03-01:08].\n\n2. **Border Irregularity**: Look at the edges of the mole. Benign moles typically have smooth, even borders. If the mole has irregular, scalloped, or poorly defined edges, this could indicate a problem [Video 1].\n\n3. **Color**: Observe the color of the mole. A variety of colors (including shades of brown, black, or even red, white, or blue) can be a warning sign.\n\n4. **Diameter**: Monitor the size of the mole. Moles larger than 6mm (about the size of a pencil eraser) should be examined by a healthcare professional.\n\n5. **Evolving Changes**: Pay attention",

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden",

Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff?

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your",

And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes what I'll see, you can actually grab a towel to help you out with that and tuck that towel into your sight. And so now, as we rotate around that towel, that's a little bit better. The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my",

Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

For example, if you're working on your left shoulder, lay on your left side [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:53-05:00].\n\n2. **Elbow Placement**: Bend your elbow at a 90-degree angle and keep it close to your side. This positioning is crucial for targeting the rotator cuff effectively [Video 2: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48].\n\n3. **Movement**: With your elbow fixed at your side, rotate your forearm upward towards the ceiling. This movement should be done against gravity, which increases the effectiveness of the exercise [Video 2: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48].\n\n4. **Weight Consideration**: It is recommended to use a light dumbbell or no weight initially to avoid strain. Performing this exercise lying down helps maintain proper form and reduces the risk of injury [Video 1: s4wUK",

Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there.

And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your",

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal",

For this exercise, you can start on your left side if you are working on your right shoulder. Your right elbow should be bent at a 90-degree angle, resting against your side [Video 2: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 04:53-05:00].\n\n2. **Movement**: Keeping your elbow close to your body, rotate your forearm towards your abdomen. This movement should be controlled and performed against gravity, which is essential for effectively targeting the rotator cuff muscles [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48].\n\n3. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10-15 repetitions, ensuring that you maintain proper form throughout the exercise. Avoid using weights that are too heavy, as this can lead to improper technique and potential injury.\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Focus on slow, controlled movements to prevent strain. If you experience any pain, stop the exercise immediately and consult a healthcare professional.\n\nBy following these",

Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your",

Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal",

People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes what I'll see, you can actually grab a towel to help you out with that and tuck that towel into your sight. And so now, as we rotate around that towel, that's a little bit better. The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my",

Attach a handle to the cable.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Hold the handle with the hand opposite to the cable. Your elbow should be bent at a 90-degree angle, resting against your side. Ensure your feet are shoulder-width apart for stability.\n\n3. **Execution**: Begin the exercise by rotating your forearm away from your body while keeping your elbow close to your side. Focus on moving from your shoulder, not your wrist. Rotate until your forearm is parallel to the ground, then return to the starting position. \n\n4. **Repetitions**: Perform 10-15 repetitions for 2-3 sets, ensuring controlled movements throughout the exercise.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Avoid using dumbbells for this exercise while standing, as it may not effectively target the rotator cuff. Instead, consider performing the exercise lying down for better support and control [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48]. Always maintain proper form to prevent injury.",

Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing.

We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side. My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity. And so this is actually my first rotator cuff exercise that I want to share with you guys. Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train",

Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those.

Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own. You won't regret it. I love these exercises. And so what we're gonna do is some band or some cable internal",

And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes what I'll see, you can actually grab a towel to help you out with that and tuck that towel into your sight. And so now, as we rotate around that towel, that's a little bit better. The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my",

Ensure the cable is set at a height that allows for effective external rotation. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart for stability.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: Hold the cable handle with your elbow bent at a 90-degree angle, keeping your elbow close to your side. Your shoulder should be slightly flexed, about shoulder height [Video 3: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 11:18-11:22].\n\n3. **Execution**: Slowly pull the cable handle straight back and away from your body, rotating your forearm outward. Focus on engaging the rotator cuff muscles during this movement. Ensure that your elbow remains stationary at your side throughout the exercise [Video 1: s4wUKmr2xtA, Time: 05:43-05:48].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Perform the exercise for a set number of repetitions, typically 10-15, ensuring controlled movements to avoid strain.\n\n**Safety Considerations**: Avoid using excessive weight that could compromise form.

Don't train your rotator cuff with a dumbbell standing up, do it laying down. So this is an external rotation exercise. Again, elbows at your side, you're going to rotate away from your body and up towards the ceiling. Keep that elbow stuck in nice and tight. What you're going to shoot for is about 10 to 15 reps, and then you're going to do that three times. Now, you can also train your internal rotators. So again, the motions that the rotator cap does would be external rotation and internal rotation. We need to train both of those. External rotations may be a little bit more important, but let's not forget about the internal rotators. rotators. To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front",

My right elbow is at a 90 degree angle with the weight down right in front of me. Now what I'm going to do is keep that right elbow into my side as I rotate that weight up towards the ceiling. Gravity is still pushing that weight straight down, but because I changed the direction that I'm moving because I'm laying on my side now, all of a sudden for me to rotate up towards the ceiling is a rotation exercise against gravity.

So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we need to do is we need to work against gravity with our free weights in order to make it an effective exercise. And so if I grab my weight right here and then if I I do this rotator cuff exercise in and out. You'll see that the resistance is actually straight down. It's an isometric contraction, meaning there's no motion occurring at my biceps. It takes a lot for my biceps to hold this at a 90 degree angle. Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable",

Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you go through that resisted extension and external rotation. Again, that's going to work those muscles right in the back of your shoulder. Finally, third exercise, again, we can't forget about the internal rotators. Now, I always tell people, I'm twice as worried about the external rotators as I am about the internal rotators. It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the",

To train those internal rotators, the exercise, the dumbbell exercise that I like. Well, let me back up. I don't really like this exercise. I prefer to train this standing with cables just because in order to train it with a dumbbell, you actually have to lay on your shoulder, kind of creates a little bit of some pressure, some impingement stuff in there. While you're strengthening this, it's not my favorite, but if dumbbells are all you have, it's better than nothing. And so to demonstrate that, let's go ahead and you're going to laid down on your right side your elbow comes out in front of you just a little bit your elbow is bent to a 90 degree angle while you grab that freeway. Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your",

Now I'm gonna kick on these external rotators, so now I'm gonna move through this motion, but that resistance is still straight down. In order to resist that rotator cuff motion, I need to create a different line of pull on it. need to either use a cable or I need to do the dumbbell, this rotation a little bit differently, which actually leads us to the first exercise that I want to show you guys. We're going to get into some sideline external rotation. What you'll do is you're going to lay down on your side. You'll see here I'm laying down on my left side.

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

Now what you're going to do is keep your elbow bent as you pull that freeway up towards the ceiling up nice and slow and then down nice and slow. Again, not my favorite because you're laying on your shoulder but it's a resisted motion against that internal rotation range we're going up and we're going against gravity while we do it And it becomes an effective way to train your internal rotators. So external rotators and internal rotators, those are two of my favorite Numbel exercises to hit those. So my favorite way to train the rotator cuff muscles are actually with these three exercises with your bands or with your cables that I want to show you right now. Now, in the gym, you can use a cable machine to set this up. I'm here at home. We actually have these resistance bands at home. Probably one of my favorite home pieces of equipment, just because of all the different exercises and all the different lines of pole that you can create with them. What I'm going to do is I'll leave a link down below in the description to this video. You can go there to check out the resistance bands that I have. Maybe pick up a pair of your own.

And so a lot of times when I see people doing this, there's two mistakes that I see most often. People will set up okay, but then what they do is they let their elbow kind of migrate out to the side in this direction and then back down. And so what this is, we're not rotating the shoulder joint. This motion is called abduction. We're abducting the shoulder joint. We're working on the deltoid muscle, not the rotator cuff. And so what you need to do is keep your elbow tucked right into your sight. Now, oftentimes",

It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there. What that's doing is that's adding a rotation component to the extension. It just kicks those rotator cuff muscles on a little bit more as you",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this. Now he can also do what we call plain massage. So he brings the fingers together and pulls them apart like this. This is something you can do anywhere. Probably can't do a driving because you gotta have your hands on the wheel. But you could certainly do this in the office or while you're watching TV. It's just a great one to do. Now he's working his way down and deck again kind of doing this plane and pulling the fingers down towards the front. So my goodness, all right, Brad, why don't you mic back up and by the way, I want to tell you two, if you get a pain or numbness or tingling, that's going all the way down from your neck into the arm and hand.

Three steps. The first one is pressure, then wound packing, then a turnicant. So let's start with pressure. If you come up on a bleeding patient that has a wound, the first step you're going to do is put pressure on it. If it's a large wound, you're going to put your entire palm of your hand and all of your weight on the wound. We're going to put a lot of pressure and hopefully that stops the bleed. If it stops the bleed, you need to maintain the pressure on the wound until help arrives. If that doesn't stop the bleed, we're going to move to packing the wound with gauze. And typically, we can use a hemostatic gauze or any gauze or you can use a shirt if you have nothing available. So we're going to take the gauze and we're going to pack it inside the wound until you can't pack it any more and that's getting to the source of the bleeding so we're going to just keep packing more and more and more and it could be a deep wound so don't be afraid so once we've gotten this completely packed hopefully we can put some pressure on it and that will stop the bleeding so if you're all by yourself and you need to apply a turnicant.

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

      "answer": "If someone is bleeding severely, it is crucial to take immediate action to control the bleeding and seek medical assistance. First, apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or bandage. If blood soaks through, do not remove the initial cloth; instead, add more layers and continue applying pressure. Elevating the injured area above the heart can also help reduce bleeding.\n\nIn cases where the victim is unconscious or in shock, it is essential to recognize that shock can occur due to severe blood loss. Signs of shock include pale skin, rapid breathing, and confusion. If the victim shows these symptoms, lay them down and elevate their legs to improve blood flow to vital organs [Video 2: KMpG4A1-dZ4, Time: 02:53-02:58]. \n\nAlways call for emergency medical help immediately, especially if the bleeding does not stop or if there are signs of internal bleeding, such as bruising or abdominal pain [Video 1: KMpG4A1-dZ4, Time: 01:27-01:36]. In summary, controlling the bleeding and recognizing signs of shock are critical steps in managing severe bleeding emergencies.",

I'm going to go ahead and have my timer getting ready to go and I'll just explain as we go along, but it's going to be 30 second stretches, three on each side and we're going to take a little 10 second rest break in between. So I'm going to go ahead and start it and then we'll go along. So with the quad stretch standing, you're just gonna grab your foot and make sure the top part of your leg is straight down. So the important part of that stretch is that that quad is down. If it's here, you're not really gonna",

What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder. So that's your exercise number one. Exercise number two would be an extension with external rotation. So to set that up, I'm now going to face my anchor. I get into this position. Elbows straight shoulders at about shoulder flexes up to about shoulder height. And then what you're going to do is just pull kind of straight back and behind you. Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

This is very simple, but you need to know how to do it, because if you do it wrong, you can actually end up hurting yourself. Exactly, so all right. Let's start off with the first thing you want to do is you actually with most of these crutches now They have a little push pin here And there's actually some numbers along here like this for example goes all the way from five one to five nine So it's a good starting point if you're five nine Go ahead and set it up at five nine That's the push the buttons in it's a telescoping needle where and I was like the turret just a little bit and then you can slide that up and down But you gotta get those holes lined up so they click and the button pops out just like that. And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right?

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

I'd have them do this and they go oh that kind of hurts It just doesn't feel that good. Yep. So then we would go to the towel and And they would take it home, they'd use the towel for a couple of days and they come back. And by then they were almost ready to do it without the towel then. Yeah, even no towel pain with the towel, less pain, more range of motion. But still not all the way, you know, we're looking for full extension. Our end goal is that you can do it without the towel and you have full motion. That's your end goal. However you get there. You might use a mix of of towel and no towel But you can use your hands kind of like this. Your hands sometimes work too. Yeah, little tricks tricks that we'll show you And then we're gonna go on to the last one is just for the rotation now. This was a little tricky It is you can actually rotate right till left and just give a little over pressure on your jaw Always really get lost on these by the way. Yeah, you don't want your head forward like this And then working on rotation, that's actually not good for the neck. You want to have really good posture, a lot of times, like I said, an upright chair with the neck.",

Key assessment criteria include inspecting for any abnormalities such as bleeding, bumps, or bruises. For example, when assessing the head, check the back for any changes and confirm initial findings, noting any signs of trauma or injury, such as \"no bleeding\" or \"bumps\" [Video 1: UrC0lUVWZ00, Time: 03:53-03:54]. \n\nDuring the assessment, ensure the patient is in a comfortable position and maintain their dignity by covering them appropriately. Look for signs of distress or discomfort, which may indicate underlying issues. \n\nWarning signs to be vigilant for include any visible injuries, changes in skin color, or unusual swelling, as these may require immediate medical attention. Always document your findings and communicate any concerns to the appropriate healthcare provider for further evaluation. This thorough approach helps in identifying potential health issues early on. \n\nFor a comprehensive assessment, ensure to follow a systematic approach, checking each system and noting any abnormalities.",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

When you go from a standing position to a seated position, whether that be a chair or a bed behind you, you want to back all the way up to the surface with your crutches until you feel the chair or the bed behind your unaffected leg. Then you're going to bring the crutch around from your unaffected side to your injured side. Bring the crutches out from underneath your armpits, reach down for the hand grips. With the opposite hand, you're going to reach down for the chair or the bed. If you have a chair rest, it will be easier to reach for that. You kick the affected forward and you have a seat.

Try to cover her up to give her some decency and keep her warm, and something considered along the way as you're doing this is to, if she had glasses on or something like that, to give them a sense of security, make sure the glasses go back on the person just to make sure. One of the last things you want to note is you have to document any findings that she may have. Do we have any questions? If no questions, what we're going to do right now, I help you up right here. I'm going to break off into the groups and we can demonstrate on each other and go from there and make sure we understand the head to toe survey and the patient assessment portion of this chapter. If no questions, we'll get started on that. Okay? All right. Thank you.",

You're going to put your affected extremity or leg forward. Both crutches will be on the side of the injured leg. You're going to push up from the hand grips with one hand in the chair or the bed with the opposite hand. So you're going to lean forward, push up with both arms.

Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check out my other videos to see how you can get rid of the pain and get back to doing what you want.",

Ensure that your posture is upright to assess the fit accurately [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 00:38-00:43].\n\n2. **Adjust Crutch Height**: The top of the crutch should be about 1-2 inches below your armpits. When you hold the crutches, your elbows should be slightly bent, ideally at a 15-30 degree angle. This ensures comfort and proper support.\n\n3. **Check Handgrip Position**: Your hands should rest comfortably on the handgrips, with your wrists straight. When you grip the handgrips, your shoulders should be relaxed, not hunched [Video 1].\n\n4. **Test Stability**: Once adjusted, stand up with the crutches. Ensure that you can maintain balance and that the crutches provide adequate support without excessive strain on your arms or shoulders [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 03:30-03:35].\n\n5. **Seek Assistance**: If",

The first thing you're going to do is take one of the crutches out from the side that you're using the railing on. Place both crutches underneath the opposite side. Reach for the hand railing and you step up with your good leg, so you're going to put weight through both hands, step up with your left foot, and then you bring your crutches up. And my injured leg is hanging behind me. You're going to push through your hands and step up again. Once you're at the top of the staircase, case, bring one crutch around again, and continue walking. To descend the stairs, you're going to bring your crutches around to the opposite side as the railing that you're using and take a hold of the handrail with the other hand. To go down, you go down with your crutches first, then your injured leg comes forward, And you put the weight through your hands to step with your left foot. One step at a time. So I'll always remember to follow your doctor's orders as far as how much weight you can put through your injured leg. But if you keep things to remember when using crutches will help you heal and get home safely. Remember not to lean your armpits onto the top of the crutches. Remember to always stand tall and you're",

Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this. Once your crutches are fit correctly and you're standing up, you're going to bring one crutch around to the other side and stand up tall. Your doctor will let you know how much weight you can put through your leg. For this video, I'm demonstrating not putting any weight through my injured leg.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

This is very simple, but you need to know how to do it, because if you do it wrong, you can actually end up hurting yourself. Exactly, so all right. Let's start off with the first thing you want to do is you actually with most of these crutches now They have a little push pin here And there's actually some numbers along here like this for example goes all the way from five one to five nine So it's a good starting point if you're five nine Go ahead and set it up at five nine That's the push the buttons in it's a telescoping needle where and I was like the turret just a little bit and then you can slide that up and down But you gotta get those holes lined up so they click and the button pops out just like that. And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right? And when you're standing with good posture, when you're going to put it underneath your arms, and if you put your arms",

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

This gets from the low back even in the thoracic, and then going up, I bring my head up to the other direction, and I arched the back to the other direction. Yeah, I hollow out the back and right in here. I've got to admit, Bob, these 60 years old, and there are not a lot of 60-year-old people who have a back as flexible as he does. Mine is certainly not near that flexible. Well, I make it up for my hips and I have no motion, my hips at all. We all got crosses to bear, Brad. Yep, arch. So yeah, this is, uh, I guess this would be the camel part and this would be the cat part, but I don't know. Yes, go ahead and do our best. So cats get afraid and everyone like does. You used to have a cat. Let's get out with it. We're getting off track, Bob. Okay. Now, the next one, you can stand off.

This helps maintain balance as you prepare to stand. Next, push down through your hands on the crutches to support your weight, and stand up tall. It\u2019s important to maintain a stable posture throughout this process to prevent falls or instability. Your healthcare provider will advise you on how much weight you can place on your injured leg while standing [Video 2: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 03:30-03:35].\n\nIn summary, when standing up with crutches, position one crutch on the opposite side, push down on the crutches, and stand up straight while being mindful of your weight-bearing restrictions.

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe but are now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. TIP FIVE! That's it. A yellow shark's been an out-one or two-ing diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips. How can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

So still keeping your feet about shoulder with the part. You You want to keep your heels down on the ground and then push your bottom back as you squat down. So you want to keep those knees behind the toes. So not going down like this, but really sticking the bottom back only go down as far as you're comfortable. Again, if you feel like you have some balance issues, put a chair behind you. So if you feel like you're falling, you can just sit down in the chair. So nice and slow coming down and then coming back up. So again, just start off with about 10 of these. That's working those muscles to pump that fluid back up and then come down and slowly back up.

      "answer": "To sit down with crutches, first, position yourself close to the chair or bed. Back up until you feel the surface behind your unaffected leg. This ensures you are in the correct position to sit down safely. Next, transfer your crutches to one hand, typically the hand opposite your unaffected leg, to free up the other hand for balance. Bend your knees and lower your body while keeping your crutches steady. As you descend, aim to sit down gently, using your hands for support if necessary. \n\nThis method allows you to maintain balance and control while transitioning from standing to sitting. It is crucial to ensure that you are stable before fully releasing your grip on the crutches. Practicing this technique can help improve confidence and safety when using crutches. \n\nFor a visual demonstration, refer to the instructions provided in the video, which detail the process of transferring from a standing position to a seated position using crutches [Video 3: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 02:46-02:51].",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

This is very simple, but you need to know how to do it, because if you do it wrong, you can actually end up hurting yourself. Exactly, so all right. Let's start off with the first thing you want to do is you actually with most of these crutches now They have a little push pin here And there's actually some numbers along here like this for example goes all the way from five one to five nine So it's a good starting point if you're five nine Go ahead and set it up at five nine That's the push the buttons in it's a telescoping needle where and I was like the turret just a little bit and then you can slide that up and down But you gotta get those holes lined up so they click and the button pops out just like that. And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right?

Start by standing tall and positioning the crutches under your arms, ensuring they are about two to three finger widths below your armpits. When you begin to walk, place your weight on your hands, not your armpits, to avoid discomfort and potential nerve damage. \n\nAs you move, swing the crutches forward about one step ahead of you, then step forward with your injured leg, placing your weight through your hands on the crutches. This technique allows for stability and balance while walking. When navigating stairs, always position the crutches on the opposite side of the railing and descend by moving the crutches down first, followed by your injured leg, ensuring you maintain control and safety [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 00:38-00:43; Video 2: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 04:54-04:58].\n\nIn summary, proper crutch use involves correct fitting, weight distribution, and careful movement, especially on stairs, to ensure safety and efficiency while walking.",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right?

      "answer": "To go upstairs with crutches, you should follow a specific technique to ensure safety and balance. First, approach the stairs and position yourself so that your crutches are on the same side as the railing. Grasp the handrail with your other hand for support. \n\nWhen ascending, place your crutches on the step above you first, then bring your unaffected leg up to the same step. Your injured leg should remain on the lower step. This method allows you to use your upper body strength to lift your body while maintaining balance. It is crucial to ensure that you have a secure grip on the handrail and that your crutches are stable before moving your legs. \n\nIn summary, the key steps are to place the crutches on the step above, then bring your unaffected leg up, ensuring you are stable throughout the process. This technique helps prevent falls and injuries while navigating stairs with crutches [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 04:54-04:58].",

Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this. Once your crutches are fit correctly and you're standing up, you're going to bring one crutch around to the other side and stand up tall. Your doctor will let you know how much weight you can put through your leg. For this video, I'm demonstrating not putting any weight through my injured leg.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it.

Begin by moving your crutches to the side opposite the railing, placing both crutches underneath your opposite arm. This provides stability as you prepare to descend [Video 2: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 04:54-04:58]. \n\nNext, lower the crutches down to the next step first, ensuring they are secure. Then, bring your injured leg forward, placing it on the same step as the crutches. Finally, shift your weight onto your hands and step down with your unaffected foot [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 04:23-04:29]. \n\nIn summary, the process involves using the crutches and railing for support, moving the crutches down first, followed by your injured leg, and then stepping down with your unaffected leg. This method helps maintain balance and reduces the risk of falls while navigating stairs.",

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day.

So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

Now the key to this that I like to kick on that rotator cuff you'll see here I've got thumbs up down here at the bottom I've got thumbs out meaning I've rotated my thumb towards you ideally what I'd even shoot for so thumbs up here some even pointed back behind me there.

The idea is you do these throughout the day and that's why we usually pick one and usually why it only wants to take 30 seconds. You take 30 seconds out of your day and do the stretch real quick and then move on and you're going to have better results by spreading out over the day instead of doing one long workout or stretch. And that goes for a lot of our stretches. But sure, I'll post your stretches. Yeah. So shall we carry on, Bob? Sure. Now, again, these are, these are shown success with us personally in the clinic with our patients. So they're the real deal. Can you, are you gonna have to? Oh, I can say, you want me to do any of them. You want, yeah, go ahead. You want this? No, no, lay down, Bob. I prefer hook rotation. I'm gonna lie down. Lie down, oh, I want to go to F5. So I got in correctly. Yeah, I did. I didn't go in like this. This is what's a lot of stress on the back. You go onto your side, bring your feet up, and then roll over as long as it's still roll off the bat. You can do these with a pillow, but we're not going to know. You can do these in bed even.

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

So first of all, what is the rotator cap? The rotator cap is actually a collection of four muscles that serve to stabilize your shoulder joint Now that shoulder joint. It's a ball and socket joint. Here's the socket. Here's the ball It's actually the most mobile joint in the body We have the greatest range of motion available in three different planes of movement in our shoulder joint It's a very mobile joint, but then at the same time it needs to be a very stable joint. That's where that rotator cuff comes in. So again, what you're looking at here, this is my right shoulder blade. Looks just like that with the humorous, the arm bone hanging down right here. You've got four muscles that come off of your shoulder blade. Three of them come from the back, one of them comes from the front.

Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade.

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well.

This ensures you are positioned correctly before lying down [Video 3: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 02:46-02:51].\n\n2. **Position Yourself**: Instead of lying straight back, which can put stress on your back, turn onto your side. This position helps reduce strain on the lower back [Video 2: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 02:55-02:58].\n\n3. **Bend Your Legs**: Bring your knees up towards your chest while lying on your side. This can help alleviate pressure on your lower back and provide a more comfortable position [Video 2].\n\n4. **Use Gentle Movements**: If you feel tightness, consider doing gentle stretches or rocking motions to ease tension before lying down [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 05:24-05:26].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always ensure you are stable and balanced",

It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your",

You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair.

That's why you need something to hold onto. Up and slowly back down. Just start off with 10 of these and then work your way up to 20 or 25. The last one is going to be a squat. So still keeping your feet about shoulder with the part. You You want to keep your heels down on the ground and then push your bottom back as you squat down. So you want to keep those knees behind the toes. So not going down like this, but really sticking the bottom back only go down as far as you're comfortable. Again, if you feel like you have some balance issues, put a chair behind you. So if you feel like you're falling, you can just sit down in the chair. So nice and slow coming down and then coming back up. So again, just start off with about 10 of these. That's working those muscles to pump that fluid back up and then come down and slowly back up.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Lie on your back on the bed with your knees bent and feet flat on the surface. Ensure your back is supported and comfortable.\n\n2. **Knee Movement**: Keeping your knees together, gently move them side to side, mimicking a windshield wiper motion. This can help mobilize the lower back without straining it. If one direction causes pain, avoid that direction and focus on the other side [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 03:51-03:52].\n\n3. **Single-Leg Stretch**: After a few repetitions of the side-to-side movement, you can try a single-leg stretch. Extend one leg while keeping the other bent, leaning back slightly to maintain a straight back. Ensure that you do not overextend or push into a painful stretch [Video 2: 0w1GlJTH2x4, Time: 01:42-01:50].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Always listen to your body.

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out.

Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner.

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

And stretching out your legs is a great way to prevent all of that. So again, just within our stretching now, a little bit, getting that break in between. And then we've got one more on each side. So with the quad stretch, you should feel it right through here. Some people feel it a little bit more in their knee, That could be because maybe that joint is tight as well. So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your",

For example, gymnastics, yoga, Olympic weightlifting, woodworking, or any repetitive strain in juicing tasks such as desewer, body weighted wrist stretches. To stretch the wrist flexors, find a table or bench that plays the palm of your hand on top of the table and lean and body weight on them. This should create a slight stretch already. If you still don't feel the stretch, slightly lean forward with your body weight until you feel a slight stretch, the back of your wrist or in the inner portion of your forearm. Now if you don't feel any pain or severe pain, you are now ready to lean side to side. Nice and slow. This will mobilize the wrist and wrist",

Those are the rhomboids where the muscles that connect the spine to the shoulder blades really getting a good stretch in there. It should almost feel like the shoulder blades are trying to pinch. So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by giving this video like, and maybe subscribing to our channel too. If you have any comments or questions, please leave them below and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you for watching.",

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

Ensure your head is supported by a pillow for comfort.\n\n2. **Knee to Chest Stretch**: Gently pull one knee towards your chest while keeping the other leg straight. Hold this position for 15-30 seconds, feeling the stretch in your lower back. Switch legs and repeat.\n\n3. **Spinal Twist**: With your knees bent and feet flat on the bed, let your knees fall to one side while keeping your shoulders flat against the bed. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch sides. This helps to stretch the lower back and improve flexibility.\n\n4. **Side Stretch**: While lying on your back, reach your left arm overhead and lean to the right side, feeling a stretch along your left side. Hold for 15-30 seconds and switch sides. This can help alleviate tension in the back area [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 07:27-07:29].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always listen to your body; if any stretch causes pain, ease off or stop. It's",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on.

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

If you still don't feel the stretch, slightly lean forward with your body weight until you feel a slight stretch, the back of your wrist or in the inner portion of your forearm. Now if you don't feel any pain or severe pain, you are now ready to lean side to side. Nice and slow. This will mobilize the wrist and wrist extension and also stretch out the wrist flex muscle. To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm.

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

      "answer": "To stretch while lying down for lower back pain relief, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start Position**: Lie on your back on a flat surface, ensuring your head and neck are supported comfortably. \n\n2. **Gentle Neck Rotation**: Begin with gentle neck rotations. Keep your head in a neutral position and slowly rotate it to one side as far as comfortable, without inducing pain. Hold this position for a few seconds, then return to the center. Repeat this rotation 10 times on each side. This helps alleviate stiffness and improve mobility in the neck, which can indirectly relieve lower back tension [Video 2: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 01:17-01:21].\n\n3. **Upper Body Stretch**: For a more targeted stretch, focus on one side of your body. For instance, if stretching your left side, place your left hand on your back and gently lean to the right, allowing your left elbow to rise. This helps stretch the muscles along your back [Video 1: AtKU8zw2Jxg, Time: 07:27-07:29].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always perform these stretches gently and stop if you experience any pain. Grad",

If it makes it feel better, they're more you do it. That's the one you're going to put on your two-do list. It's a directional thing. That's a trying to determine which direction feels the best and the other thing I hope it's okay I recommend this Brad. The idea is that you do these once a day. The idea is you do these throughout the day and that's why we usually pick one and usually why it only wants to take 30 seconds. You take 30 seconds out of your day and do the stretch real quick and then move on and you're going to have better results by spreading out over the day instead of doing one long workout or stretch. And that goes for a lot of our stretches. But sure, I'll post your stretches. Yeah. So shall we carry on, Bob? Sure. Now, again, these are, these are shown success with us personally in the clinic with our patients. So they're the real deal. Can you, are you gonna",

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all.

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what",

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive. As a result of it, you have increased risk of high blood pressure, inflammation in the body, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, what have you? The parasympathetic nervous system on the other end, of which the biggest is a part, that is more responsible for what we can call call the relaxation response. So when we have the opposite of the stress response we can call that the relaxation response or the restful alertness response or the response that we get through meditation and when the vagus nerve is stimulated then that elicits the relaxation response. So it influences your eye movements, the tone of your voice and facial expressions if you're in a good mood and relaxed and people can see that in your face.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide based on their advice:\n\n1. **Identify Tight Spots**: Begin by recognizing where you feel stiffness in your lower back. This will help you focus on the right areas during your exercises [Video 2: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 01:55-02:01].\n\n2. **Perform Targeted Exercises**: Bob and Brad suggest trying out six specific exercises that address tightness in the lower back. They recommend performing each exercise while paying attention to how your body responds. If any exercise causes pain, stop immediately [Video 2].\n\n3. **Loosen Up**: The goal is to loosen the tight muscles and joints in the lower back. As you perform the exercises, you should feel relief as the stiffness decreases [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 00:35-00:38].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Always listen to your body. If you experience significant discomfort or pain during any exercise, it\u2019s crucial to stop and consult a healthcare professional if necessary [Video 2].\n\nBy following these",

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

Now these mobilization techniques and stretches are going to prevent you from RSI which is repetitive strain injury and a couple of tunnel syndrome. So you alleviate the pain from there or you can prevent you from getting these issues. Now if you're finding that you're losing a lot of grip strength from for example sports For example, golf or even tennis, these stretches and mobilization techniques are going to help you regain that grip strength once again, and even alleviate the pain that you might be getting from golf as elbow or tennis elbow. Try these stretches out, they're definitely going to help you. waves. Interlace your fingers and create a wave back and forth with the wrist and hands.

Do this 20 to 30 reps on each direction and also repeat it three to four sets, owner and radial distractions. Grab the end of the wrist with the other hand and slightly pull the wrist joint apart. This will create a small gap in a hip joint. Now, move the hip joint back and forth side to side, creating what is called radial and owner deviation. This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints.

And you can hold that for 10 to 15 seconds, and then you can switch leg, the same routine while you're holding it there, you've been in and out. That's great. Keep it for 10 to 15 seconds, be in and out, and you can try it, it's for let's say for three to four rounds each leg. The last exercise, you're going to show you it's basically Pitch is stretched and you cross the leg forward, and it's a great stretch for the hip and low back, and you're going to see them back straight to the other leg. Here we go. On the left leg, yeah, come back, there you go. Every person has a different range of movements, just feel free to work on towards your range of movements. You hold it for 10 to 15 seconds, and if you feel comfortable, you can see more back on it. and then you change legs again, you keep it for 10 to 15 seconds and change leg and relax on food, yeah, and see back on it.

And I'm going to go whatever feels best. You listen to your body, if it hurts to go this way, don't it feels good and you're doing pelvic tilt? Yeah, exactly.

It's typically those external rotators. These little guys in the back of your shoulder, right here, that are weak. And those are the ones that often cause the pain and the dysfunction. You're internal rotators. They're actually assisted by this big peck muscle that kind of assists in this internal rotation motion Therefore, it's typically not as weak as the external rotators So we don't need to train it as hard, but then at the same time I don't want to neglect it. So to train those internal rotators What we're gonna do now all of a sudden it's in my left hand. So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture.

So I'm my left elbows at a 90 degree angle and tuck the end right to my side again. Don't worry about sticking it right into your side. Worried about the form as you're going through the motion. Start it with my hand high here, and then as I pull across, I'm gonna finish with my hand lower here. So high here, lower here, really good posture. While you do this, I don't want you to round forward and really if you're pulling with that peck muscle, that has a tendency to take over. Keep your chest high, keep your shoulders back, keep the elbow at a 90, keep your hand high on the outside. all the way to low on the inside and then right back out. What I typically tell people to shoot for is three sets of 10 to 12 of each one of those exercises in order to maximize strength and function in that rotator cuff. Okay, guys, I think that's everything. So again, shared with you about five of my favorite exercises, two with dumbbells, three with bands to strengthen your rotator cuff. Again, it's imperative that those rotator cuff muscles are strong and healthy to keep your shoulder pain free and functional. So I hope you guys enjoyed this video. If you did, do me a favor, hit that thumbs up button",

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting. Move side to side for about 20 to 30 reps and repeat it for the five times. Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow stretch. To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest.

But if you're leaning forward again, you're taking away from that stretch. to keep your upper body nice and upright and just pull backwards. Again, you don't have to pull up as high as I do. I stretch every day, so I'm pretty flexible. So if you can only go to there, that's okay. You just go until you feel uncomfortable, stretch with that.

So I'm going to go ahead and start it and then we'll go along. So with the quad stretch standing, you're just gonna grab your foot and make sure the top part of your leg is straight down. So the important part of that stretch is that that quad is down. If it's here, you're not really gonna get a good stretch. So you want it there and maybe even back just a little bit. The closer you can get your heel to the bottom, your bottom, the better stretch you're gonna get. But you don't have to pull it all the way back. Just pull it until you feel a little stretch in there. And then take that little break in between. But again, if your thighs coming forward, then you're no longer stretching your quads. So you really wanna focus on that. So if you have to hold on a lot to be able to do that, that's fine. Also the most important thing, second to getting that leg back there, is not to lean forward because see you can be like, well, my",

So once I go to a stretch that feels very good to my comfort level, I hold that up to 15 to 30 seconds, again, relax and do 3 to 5 repetitions. And hopefully this does a lot for those shoulders, helps them bring them back, gets you a lot of relief. Give it a try. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your support by giving this video like, and maybe subscribing to our channel too.

Ensure it is at a comfortable height for you to grip.\n\n2. **Grip the Bar**: Stand under the bar and reach up to grasp it with both hands, palms facing away from you. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart for stability.\n\n3. **Hang Freely**: Allow your body to hang down, keeping your legs straight. This position helps to decompress the spine and stretch the lower back. Ensure that you maintain a relaxed posture while hanging [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 09:40-09:38].\n\n4. **Engage Your Core**: While hanging, engage your core muscles to support your lower back. Avoid excessive swinging or jerking movements, as these can strain your back.\n\n5. **Duration**: Hang for about 20-30 seconds, taking deep breaths to relax your body further. If you feel any discomfort, ease off the stretch.\n\n6. **Safety Note**: If you have any pre-existing back conditions or experience pain while hanging, consult a healthcare professional before attempting this stretch",

Before sampling, confirm the patient's identity. If a recent change in ventilator setting has been made, wait approximately 20 to 30 minutes before sampling. that the arterial line is functioning properly. Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

In your dominant hand, take the syringe with exposed needle attached and hold it like a pencil, approach the skin at 30 to 45 degrees in line with the radial artery, pointing toward the elbow. The needle should enter the radial artery immediately below the gloved fingers of the non-dominant hand. Keep the skin taught and enter the skin with a brisk movement. Once in the soft tissue, gently advance the needle to where you think the radial artery is. It is easy to go straight through the radial artery if you rush, you may feel a slight give as the needle penetrates the wall of the radial artery. Once the needle enters the artery, you should see a flashback of blood pulsating into the syringe. If you don't see blood, you have missed the artery and will have to withdraw the needle somewhat and then re-aign the syringe toward the pulsating artery. Instruct the patient not to move the arm or wrist in order to prevent the needle from becoming dislodged. Blood gas syringes fill automatically, stopping at an average of two milliliters. If using a regular syringe, you will have to stabilize the syringe with your non-dominant hand, and, with your dominant hand, gently withdraw the plunger of the syringe. Once the syringe has filled, or sufficient blood has been collected, hold its steady to prevent air aspiration, and then withdraw the needle. Immediately place a gauze pad or cotton ball over the site, and firmly apply pressure for 5 to 10",

Next, remove a test route from the vinyl and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point a warmer and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample.

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

If you still am paying when using this, then speed your healthcare professional about getting thinner landscapes.

If a recent change in ventilator setting has been made, wait approximately 20 to 30 minutes before sampling. that the arterial line is functioning properly. Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

          "text": "Hi, my name is Lisa, and I'm a physical therapist here at the Nebraska Medical Center. And I'm here today to show you some basic tips for how to use crutches correctly. If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

Ensure that the grooves of the lancet align properly. Twist off the cap to expose the needle, then replace the cap securely until you hear a click to ensure it\u2019s locked in place [Video 1: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 01:12-01:16].\n\n2. **Warm Your Hands**: Before lancing, warm your hands to facilitate blood flow. This makes it easier to obtain a blood sample without needing to apply excessive pressure [Video 2: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 03:41-03:44].\n\n3. **Position the Device**: Place the lancing device firmly against the side of your finger. This area is less sensitive and allows for a better sample [Video 2: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 03:41-03:44].\n\n4. **Activate the Device**: Press the release button to puncture the skin. After the puncture, remove the device from your finger [Video 2: eOsY84",

If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video.

Next, remove a test route from the vinyl and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point a warmer and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself.

But most importantly, I'm going to teach you some really useful tips that everybody should know. So, this is my lancing device. They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

      "answer": "To use a blood glucose meter effectively, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Meter**: Ensure your blood glucose meter and test strips are functioning properly. It's important to check that the control solution has been opened and tested to confirm accurate readings [Video 3].\n\n2. **Wash Your Hands**: Before testing, wash your hands with soap and warm water. Warming your hands can help blood flow, making it easier to obtain a sample [Video 2: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 03:41-03:44].\n\n3. **Use the Lancet Device**: Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger. Press the release button to puncture the skin, then remove the device from the puncture site. If needed, apply very light pressure around the area to encourage blood flow [Video 2].\n\n4. **Collect the Blood Sample**: Touch the blood drop to the test strip on the meter. Ensure that the strip absorbs the blood properly for an accurate reading.\n\n5. **Record Your Results**: After obtaining your blood glucose level, write it down in your monitoring diary or electronic records. Consistency is key, so try to use the same meter for",

So perform a controlled solution test each time you open a new via the test strips, or you feel like your meter isn't working properly. Let's say it's giving them an expected results, or you may have dropped it or damaged it. Now I've left more information in the description below about this. So, so, continuing on from our Lansing device part, to test out the glucose, we need to get a few things ready. So we need the glucose monitor, it's the civic test strips that are in date. A primed and ready-to-use lancing device which we did earlier. A column wall pad, a yellow sharp spin, and a monitoring diary so we can put our results in at the end. Next, remove a test route from the vinyl and insert it into your blood glucose meter. It should switch on at this point a warmer and it will tell you when it's ready for your blood sample. Now, a word of warning for the next scene, there will be a little bit of blood. So if you don't like the site of blood, skip forward maybe about 30 seconds. I'll",

Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video.

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check out my other videos to see how you can get rid of the pain and get back to doing what you want.",

Press the release button to puncture the skin. This will create a small drop of blood. Warming your hands beforehand can help facilitate blood flow without needing to apply excessive pressure [Video 3: eOsY84oYqKg, Time: 03:41-03:44].\n\n2. **Collect the Blood Sample**: After the puncture, a small drop of blood should form. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area of the finger to encourage more blood to flow out [Video 3].\n\n3. **Apply Blood to the Test Strip**: Bring the blood drop close to the testing strip. The strip should have a designated area where the blood is to be applied. Ensure that the blood touches this area without smearing it across the strip.\n\n4. **Follow Manufacturer's Instructions**: Always refer to the specific instructions provided with your blood glucose meter and test strips for optimal results and safety.\n\nRemember to dispose of the lancet safely after use to prevent injury [Video 1].",

Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

They're used to obtain a some wood blood, usually from the finger for our blue glucose meter. Here's the first tip. Wash your hands with One water and normal soap before you begin and make sure you drive. Now, one of your hands gives the puncture side better blood flow so it's easier to collect a sample. Rubbing your hands also helps with this. To load a lancing device, it's pretty simple. You first twist this cap off. Then you get yourself a lancet that hasn't been used pop it in so that the grooves are in line. Next twist this cap off and now the needle is visible. So please be careful. Next get this cap, pop it back on, twist it on, should click and that's it. Tip 2, use a new lancer every time you use your lancing device. I know I know it's time consuming but remember this. Every time you use your lancer the needle becomes dull so one is going to hurt more and two you're at risk of a skin infection. Next is the depth indicator which is the thing that I'm twisting here and it just just how deep the lancer tip will go into your finger. Now this isn't something that I",

If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and pushing the land sit needle into it. Now it's no longer exposed and easy to remove. So let me know how you get on my guide by leaving a comment below because I love to read it. Thanks for watching! Hey guys, thanks for watching this week's video. Make sure to click that like, follow or subscribe but are now to stay up to date with new weekly videos. TIP FIVE! That's it. A yellow shark's been an out-one or two-ing diary to input our results in. Who says input? Testing your glucose meter or your test strips. How can you be sure that the phone isn't going to ring?",

Place the lancet device firmly on the side of your finger, press the release button and remove the device from the puncture side. Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself.

You want to work your way up to a minute, even two minutes if you can. So again, you're working those muscles, but you also have the assistance of gravity to get that blood flow coming back down. You can also have this circular motion as a little uncomfortable on your hips, you can just push up and down almost like a stair stepper in reverse. So just kind of push in that way and then coming back down. The next exercises are going to be standing up. The next exercises are going to be calf raises or heel raises. Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart. If you have some slight balance issues, make sure you're holding onto a countertop or a sturdy chair.

You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time. Now, no doubt you can also wheel in an ultrasound machine and use ultrasound for peripheral access. But the truth is, the ultrasound is not a great tool for small peripheral veins. It's great for deep veins. And also, by the way, you would not make too many surgeons happy by willing in and not the cell machine at the time where we already laid 20 to 25 minutes now. Instead, I will teach you a technique, which I call reverse Smark, that will allow you to find an IV access, draw blood, or cannulate veins, even in the most difficult patients.

As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented. So what that does, it causes engagement of the peripheral veins. One better way to apply a turnicate is to apply a blood pressure cuff and basically just set it at 90 millimeters of mercury or something below the diastolic pressure. Now veins can be The large, the better seen, also by using several other methods. No patients coming to the operating room have already fasted their dehydrated their frightened scared. They have a very high sympathetic outflow. The operating room can be called, and all of these factors together conspire to result in significant diminution of the peripheral veins. You can do several things to improve the venous flow and enlargement of the veins. The patient should immediately be warmed up by application of bear hugger or forced air warming devices, application of warm compresses, and things like that, but that really takes time.

      "answer": "To use a peak flow meter effectively, begin by standing up straight. Hold the meter so that the indicator is at the bottom when you place it in your mouth. This positioning is crucial for accurate readings. After ensuring a proper grip, take a deep breath, filling your lungs completely, and then place your lips tightly around the mouthpiece. Exhale forcefully and quickly into the meter to obtain a reading. It's important to perform this action in a single, swift motion to ensure you get the best measurement of your peak expiratory flow rate.\n\nThis device is user-friendly, making it accessible even for children as young as four years old, which highlights its ease of use. Regular monitoring with a peak flow meter can help track lung function, especially for individuals with asthma or other respiratory conditions, allowing for timely interventions if readings fall below normal ranges [Video 1: RRLY6anXXQo, Time: 00:27-00:33]. In summary, using a peak flow meter involves proper positioning, a deep breath, and a forceful exhalation to measure lung function accurately.",

After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done! One last thing before I go, make sure to remove your used test strips and land sit and put them in your yellow sharp spin. The safest way to remove your land sit is by placing the land sit cap on a hard surface and",

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

Then we have to look for internal bleeding, the signs of internal bleeding are bruises or contusions of the skin, painful, tender, rigid and bruised abdomen, vomiting or coughing of blood, stools that are black or contain bright red blood. What is to be done if there is internal bleeding? For severe internal bleeding follow these steps, monitor ABC, airway, breathing and circulation. Keep the victim lying on his or her left side. This will help prevent expulsion of vomit from stomach or allow the vomit to drain and also prevent the victim from inhaling vomit. trade the shock by raising the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, and seek immediate medical attention. Here is an activity to test your knowledge. Sir, sometimes the victim is very serious or unconscious. What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy",

Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done!

If bloodshed through both dressings, remove them and apply a fresh bandage, ensuring they's direct pressure applied at the point of bleeding. Support the injured part with a sling or bandage. But check circulation every 10 minutes. Keep monitoring the casualties level of response while waiting for help to arrive. So remember, when treating severe bleeding, wear gloves if available. Remove or cut away any clothing from around the womb. Check for objects in the womb, but don't remove them. Apply pressure on either side of the womb. It is not object in the womb, use a dressing or pad, and apply direct pressure to the womb. Call 99 or 1-1-2-4 emergency help. Secure the dressing with a bandage. To do the casualty for shock, support the engine area, keep checking their level of response while waiting for help, and that's how we treat someone with a severe bleed.",

So vericose fanes happen when you don't have good circulation in your legs. So what then happens is everything kind of pulls up in your legs, the blood, and then it makes those fanes pop out looking like and puppy em bulging. So if you do exercises, it helps increase the circulation and kind of work that blood back out of your system. So the first exercise is we're going to do on the ground so we have gravity to help assist that blood flow get back into your system. So lie down on your back. The leg that you want to work kind of straighten it out, you can leave this one propped up if you want to. Pull your toes up towards you to help straighten out your leg. This is just going to be a straight leg raise, but you're going to do a hold at the top to help get that blood flow coming back down. So you're exercising the muscles and you're using gravity to help with that blood flow flow. So bring it up nice and slow just about even with the other side and hold it there for about five to ten seconds. And your muscle is going to probably start shaking after three or four seconds, but if you can just try and hold it there and then slowly come back down. So",

I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

So before we begin, I want to note that this is not intended for anybody that has shoulder instability or has had complete shoulder replacement surgeries or any surgery for that matter. If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

      "answer": "To manage shock, immediate actions are crucial. Shock is a condition where the circulatory system fails to provide adequate blood flow to the body's organs, leading to potential organ failure. First, it is essential to recognize the signs of shock, which may include altered mental status, rapid heartbeat, shallow breathing, and cold, clammy skin [Video 2: KMpG4A1-dZ4, Time: 02:53-02:58].\n\nIn cases where a victim is unconscious or seriously ill, the priority is to ensure their safety and seek immediate medical attention. While waiting for help, it is important to lay the victim down and elevate their legs about 12 inches to improve blood flow to vital organs [Video 2: KMpG4A1-dZ4, Time: 02:53-02:58]. Additionally, monitor their breathing and pulse, and be prepared to perform CPR if necessary.\n\nIn summary, recognizing the signs of shock and taking prompt action\u2014such as positioning the victim correctly and seeking emergency assistance\u2014are vital steps in managing this critical condition. The provided video evidence emphasizes the importance of these interventions.",

Then you're going to bring the crutch around from your unaffected side to your injured side. Bring the crutches out from underneath your armpits, reach down for the hand grips. With the opposite hand, you're going to reach down for the chair or the bed. If you have a chair rest, it will be easier to reach for that. You kick the affected forward and you have a seat. Nice and controlled. What you don't want to do is just look back to see if it's there. Bring your crutches forward and have a seat like this. Once your crutches are fit correctly and you're standing up, you're going to bring one crutch around to the other side and stand up tall. Your doctor will let you know how much weight you can put through your leg. For this video, I'm demonstrating not putting any weight through my injured leg. You're going to bring your crutches forward first, swing the affected or injured leg forward first, and then take a small step with your good leg. forward, step.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right?

If you have rotator cuff issues, major issues into the shoulder, this is not designed for it. So don't even ask. If you have to ask, my answer is always going to be instead to go talk to your local doctor to get a recommendation. So how we're going to reset a forward rounded shoulder is with a push pull exercise. You need two things. The first being a hand washing towel that is going to act as a cushion and the next is a door frame so I hope you have a door frame. What we're going to do is take the side that we're looking to reset or self adjust and put the cushion or that wash cloth right here right up against the door and we're going to put our elbow directly into it. want to position the arm and shoulder to the point where the tricep or the bottom of the arm is parallel with the floor. The hand should kind of just rest right over the shoulder. When you do this, just feel like you're kind of reaching backwards with your fingers. So I'm going to then take the opposite side leg, in this case it would be my right,",

      "answer": "To adjust crutches for a proper fit, begin by ensuring that the crutches are the correct height. When standing upright, the top of the crutches should be approximately 1-2 inches below your armpits. Additionally, the handgrips should be at wrist level when your arms are relaxed at your sides. This positioning allows for optimal support and comfort while using the crutches.\n\nLisa, a physical therapist, emphasizes the importance of proper fitting for effective crutch use. She notes that if the crutches are not adjusted correctly, it can lead to discomfort and ineffective mobility [Video 2: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 00:38-00:43]. \n\nIn summary, adjusting crutches involves ensuring they are the right height and that handgrips are at the appropriate level. Proper fitting is crucial for safe and effective use, as it helps maintain balance and reduces the risk of injury while moving.",

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

So first of all, what is the rotator cap? The rotator cap is actually a collection of four muscles that serve to stabilize your shoulder joint Now that shoulder joint. It's a ball and socket joint. Here's the socket. Here's the ball It's actually the most mobile joint in the body We have the greatest range of motion available in three different planes of movement in our shoulder joint It's a very mobile joint, but then at the same time it needs to be a very stable joint. That's where that rotator cuff comes in. So again, what you're looking at here, this is my right shoulder blade. Looks just like that with the humorous, the arm bone hanging down right here. You've got four muscles that come off of your shoulder blade. Three of them come from the back, one of them comes from the front. And then you can see that they kind of wrap around the head of that humorous to form a cuff around it. Okay, so now why is that important? important in order for the shoulder to function properly, that socket or the student that ball of the humorous needs to fit squarely into the socket of the shoulder blade.

And Brad's actually a little taller than fine nine, but he must have shrunk a little bit because he's now fit. Yeah, so then you stand up with posture, right?

      "answer": "To fit crutches properly under your arm, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Positioning**: Stand up straight and hold the crutches with your hands. The top of the crutches should be about one to two inches below your armpits when you are standing straight. This ensures they are not too high or low, which can cause discomfort or improper use [Video 1: pYzUQb79_Rw, Time: 00:38-00:43].\n\n2. **Hand Grip**: Your hands should grip the handholds comfortably, with your elbows slightly bent. This position allows you to maintain balance and control while using the crutches.\n\n3. **Weight Distribution**: When using the crutches, ensure that your weight is distributed through your hands and not your armpits. This prevents nerve damage and discomfort in the underarm area, which can occur if the crutches are pressed too hard against your body.\n\n4. **Adjusting Height**: If the crutches feel uncomfortable or if you experience pain, adjust the height accordingly. It\u2019s crucial that the crutches fit you well to promote safe and effective mobility.\n\nAlways consult with a healthcare professional if you are unsure about the fitting process or",

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

While you're doing that, you don't want to hold your back and then your legs. go for a few reps, semi, especially all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, yeah, and relax, relax, relax, that's all, that's all, that's perfect, you want to go for three sets of, you let's say eight to ten, you can try these every and hour or two hours once, yeah, the next move, you're going to go for a single-leg stretch, basically, and lean in the stretch. You can move it forward, you have perfect, and you're trying to maintain your back kind of straight, lean back to the beat, maybe that's cool. Yeah, you don't want to go for a really high stretch, as long as you feel the stretch that you've got. And you can hold that for 10 to 15 seconds, and then you can switch leg, the same routine while you're holding it there, you've been in and out. That's great.

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're going to hold that for five seconds and repeat that five times. You're going to want to do that to each side, going back, and going forward. And yes, you're going to look awesome while doing these exercises. Motion is the key to getting better, but not too much. you want to go up to the point of pain, or just shy of it, but not through it. Remember with a pain, you can go to it, but not through it. Most of the time, you should be able to get rid of the pain by doing what I've shown you. If not, come in for a visit. The sooner you come in, the easier it is to treat and the faster you get better.

Mine is certainly not near that flexible. Well, I make it up for my hips and I have no motion, my hips at all. We all got crosses to bear, Brad. Yep, arch.

Ensure your wrists are aligned under your shoulders and your knees under your hips.\n\n2. **Cat Position**: Inhale deeply and arch your back upwards, tucking your chin to your chest. This is the \"cat\" position. Hold this position briefly.\n\n3. **Camel Position**: Exhale and lower your back, allowing your stomach to drop towards the floor while lifting your head and tailbone upwards. This is the \"camel\" position. Hold for a moment.\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat these movements smoothly, transitioning between the cat and camel positions. It is important to perform these movements gently and avoid any sharp pain. If you experience discomfort, particularly sharp pain, skip the exercise or modify it as needed [Video 1: CmGVHk0Ax4M, Time: 06:50-06:52].\n\n5. **Frequency**: Aim for several repetitions, gradually increasing as you feel more comfortable. You may notice improvement with consistent practice [Video 1].\n\nAlways listen to your body and consult a healthcare professional if",

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

This is a great mobilization technique, as it can reduce pain and stiffness at the base of the inner and outer sides of the wrist joints. The type of pain and stiffness that I'm talking about is normally caused by repetitive",

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner.

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

Now these mobilization techniques and stretches are going to prevent you from RSI which is repetitive strain injury and a couple of tunnel syndrome. So you alleviate the pain from there or you can prevent you from getting these issues. Now if you're finding that you're losing a lot of grip strength from for example sports For example, golf or even tennis, these stretches and mobilization techniques are going to help you regain that grip strength once again, and even alleviate the pain that you might be getting from golf as elbow or tennis elbow. Try these stretches out, they're definitely going to help you. waves. Interlace your fingers and create a wave back and forth with the wrist and hands. Try to exaggerate each wrist extension and wrist flexion on each movement. Do this nice and slow and in a controlled manner. Do about 20 to 30 reps three to four sets. wrist rolls. Once again, interlace your fingers and roll your wrist back and forth. It almost looks like a shape of a figure eight. Or in your finish side.

I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

Now these mobilization techniques and stretches are going to prevent you from RSI which is repetitive strain injury and a couple of tunnel syndrome. So you alleviate the pain from there or you can prevent you from getting these issues. Now if you're finding that you're losing a lot of grip strength from for example sports For example, golf or even tennis, these stretches and mobilization techniques are going to help you regain that grip strength once again, and even alleviate the pain that you might be getting from golf as elbow or tennis elbow. Try these stretches out, they're definitely going to help you. waves. Interlace your fingers and create a wave back and forth with the wrist and hands.

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there.

It's probably the most common cause of shoulder pain that I see. If you're interested in learning more about that, there's a link down below in the description. I'm also gonna put a link right up here, floating around right now. That will take you to a video that I saw all about how to treat your shoulder pain and your shoulder impingement. But for now, what I wanna do is jump into these rotator cuff exercises. one of the best things you can do to avoid pain and even to get yourself out of pain is to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles so that they serve their proper function. So I want to show you some of my favorite rotator cuff strengthening exercises, but before I do that, I want to show you my least favorite rotator cuff exercise. So when I ask, okay, what are you doing for your rotator cuff? They'll stand there and they'll say, okay, well, I get a pair of dumbbells, I hold them in my hands and then I internally and externally rotate just like I'm showing you right here in this little clip. Now here's what I hate about that you guys. It's not a rotator cuff exercise. Gravity always acts on free weights the same way. Gravity is always going to push that straight down. And so what we",

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

          "text": "Hi, my name's Debbie. I'm a chartered physiotherapist at the Georgia Lea Hospital and it test-trust. In this short video I'm going to show you how to safely apply a nice pack. We use ice in physiotherapy to reduce swelling and pain after a recent injury, like a spray and ankle. The easiest way to apply ice at home is to use a bag of frozen peas. You want small chunks of ice not ice cubes. Wrap your peas in a damp tea towel, so wet your tea towel and ring it out well. And before you apply the piece to your skin, cover it with a cup of layers of kitchen bowl. So just put the kitchen towel over the foot, the ankle, and then place your peas on top. At home it's best to apply the ice pack with the limelavated as that will help to reduce the swelling as well. Leave the ice pack in place for a maximum of 50 minutes to make sure that you don't burn your skin with the ice. And you can repeat that up to every two hours at home. When you come to take the ice pack off your skin will be very red and may feel extremely cold, but that's perfecting all of them. If you have any questions about how to save your blind ice pack, feel free to ask the physiotherapist to treat you.",

Warming up your hands makes it easier to get blood without applying pressure. If necessary, apply very light pressure to the surrounding area until a blood drop appears. Now wipe away the first drop of blood with a clean cotton swab. With the second drop of blood, be careful not to smear it. Make sure your meat is ready and gently touch the blood drop with the test strip to collect the blood sample. The test strip will draw the blood towards itself. After a few seconds, the meter will display your blood glucose level. Write this down with any other information in the monitoring diary or a day your electronic records. Tip 5, diverted patients tend to build a collection of different blood glucose meters over the years, but it's really important to only ever use one blood glucose meter to build up a trend of results. If you're going to use different machines, you're going to end up with slightly different results, and that's not a good thing. And that's how it's done!

What is it called and how do we handle such a situation? This condition of emergency situation is called shock. Let us look at what needs to be done for shock. Shock refers to circulatory system failure that happens when the body is not getting enough blood flow. This can be a result of loss of blood due to uncontrolled bleeding, due to trauma or injury or other circulatory system problem. Loss of fluid due to dehydration or excessive sweating and occurrence of an extreme emotional event. A person in shock exhibits these symptoms, altered mental status, anxiety and restlessness, pale, cold and clammy skin, and nail beds, nausea and vomiting, rapid breathing and pulse and undressponsiveness when shock is severe. Sir, what should we do if we face a victim in shock? After first treating the person for life-threatening injuries such as breathing, inability or bleeding, we have to lay the victim on his or her back. Here is the victim's legs, 8 to 12 inches, to allow the blood to drain from the legs back to the heart. Prevent body heat loss by putting blankets and coats under and over the victim, and evacuate the casualty immediately to a general hospital. Here is an activity to test your knowledge.",

I don't know how many of you know about the importance of the biggest nerve which is one of the most important nerves in our body. It's called the 10th cranial nerve and it starts out somewhere above your mid-brain and then it comes out through the skull and it influences everything from eye movements to facial expression, to tone of voice, to heart rate variability, to breathing, and then it goes to diaphragm, and it inner weights, all the organs in the abdomen as well. So it influences lung activity, heart activity, and the activity in all the abdominal organs, including spleen, liver, kidney, and of course the intestine. And the vagus nerve has bi-directional traffic, which means it gives information from the brain to the body and from the body back to the brain. The vagus nerve is also part of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. So the sympathetic nervous system is the alerting system. It's the system that alerts us to stressful situations. It's the system that is responsible for the fight of light response. It's a system that creates alertness and prepares us for emergencies. our societies on sympathetic overdrive.

Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check out my other videos to see how you can get rid of the pain and get back to doing what you want.",

      "answer": "To detect the key signs of a stroke, you can use the FAST method, which stands for Face, Arms, Speech, and Time.\n\n1. **Face**: Ask the person to smile. Look for any drooping on one side of their face. This can indicate weakness or paralysis, which is a common sign of a stroke.\n\n2. **Arms**: Request the individual to raise both arms. Observe if one arm drifts downward or cannot be raised at all. This may suggest weakness on one side of the body [Video 2: PhH9a0kIwmk, Time: 01:21-01:23].\n\n3. **Speech**: Check for speech problems. Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. If they are unable to speak clearly or cannot understand your questions, this may indicate a stroke [Video 2: PhH9a0kIwmk, Time: 01:21-01:23].\n\n4. **Time**: If any of these signs are present, it is crucial to call emergency services immediately (999 or 112) and inform them you suspect a stroke. Prompt treatment is vital for the best outcomes [Video 1: PhH9a",

Try taking a hot shower since the steam of water can help massage your neck and relax your muscles.

If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics.

Most of the time, you should be able to get rid of the pain by doing what I've shown you. If not, come in for a visit. The sooner you come in, the easier it is to treat and the faster you get better.

Be sure to perform this slowly and stop if you experience any pain [Video 1: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29]. \n\nIn addition to side bends, consider rolling your head in a circular motion to further alleviate stiffness. It's important to keep moving your neck, as remaining still can lead to increased stiffness and pain [Video 2: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 00:41-00:43]. \n\nTo complement these movements, alternate between applying a cold compress and a heating pad for 20 minutes each. The cold compress can help reduce swelling and numb pain, while the heat can relax tight muscles [Video 1]. \n\nFinally, taking a hot shower can also be beneficial, as the steam may help loosen tightness in the neck [Video 1]. Always listen to your body and avoid any movements that cause discomfort.",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics. So you're going to take your hand and press it on your head and put your head in your hand together. You're",

When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there.

This movement helps to relieve tension in the neck muscles. Be cautious and stop if you experience any pain during this process [Video 1: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29].\n\n2. **Circular Head Rolls**: Next, gently roll your head in a circular motion. This can further help to work out any knots in the neck. Again, if you feel pain, discontinue the movement [Video 1: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29].\n\n3. **Heat and Cold Therapy**: Alternate between applying a cold compress and a heating pad for 20 minutes each. This method can reduce swelling and help numb the pain [Video 1: 6rK3QDN8MF8, Time: 00:22-00:29].\n\n4. **Avoid Inactivity**: It is important not to avoid moving your neck altogether, as this can lead to increased stiffness and prolonged",

A lot of people think, well, maybe if I just don't move my head that direction, it'll be better. This is a bad idea. If you don't move your neck, you're going to get even more stiffness, and the pain is still going to be there. Let's go over some things to help you get rid of that pain in the neck. First, start with a side bending stretch, you're going to bend your head to the side, apply a gentle pressure, hold that for 30 seconds, and repeat three times to each side. If you're getting pain, just keep it a real gentle to begin with, and eventually you're going to be able to handle more pressure. Next, try some rotation. So starting with your head in a neutral midline position, rotate your head as far as So you can, without pain, hold that for a few seconds, and then return to midline. Repeat that 10 times to each side, even if you only have pain going one direction. As your pain and motion begins to improve, increase that to 20 repetitions. If you need to, you can perform this exercise lying down on your back, which is sometimes more comfortable. Final exercise is is isometrics.

You can also go up like this. There are different angles. Yeah, different angles and the facets tend to go in that angle. So I can actually do chin touch like this too.

Those are the ones that hold a lot of stress, hold a lot of stiffness. When we're working all day, especially if we're like on the computer, we're driving, we can't hold up our shoulders, like this, and that gets a lot of tightness in there. And then that muscle right there, that levator, scalp, really gets tight, sometimes it can cause headaches, sometimes it can just cause just pain all in that upper neck, back area, and cause some stiffness. So it's really good to stretch out, and it's pretty easy to stretch it as well. So the side that you want to stretch, but I'm stretching my left side, I'm gonna take my left hand and just kind of put it on the back. And I'm going in that downward position with my elbow going up. What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch.

Keeping your neck still can lead to increased stiffness and pain [Video 1: lwhYbWFtNuE, Time: 00:41-00:43].\n\n2. **Isometric Exercises**: Begin with gentle isometric exercises. For example, you can press your head against your hand without moving your neck. This engages the muscles without causing further strain.\n\n3. **Use a Towel Roll**: Incorporate a towel roll for support. Roll a towel and place it behind your neck while sitting or lying down. This can help maintain proper alignment and reduce discomfort [Video 3: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n4. **Monitor Pain**: While performing these exercises, pay attention to your pain levels. If the pain worsens, stop the exercises immediately [Video 3: N59oOxyaE1A, Time: 04:06-04:09].\n\n5. **Maintain Proper Posture**: Ensure that your shoulders remain relaxed and back",

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area.

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

The common error that I see with a towel is people don't make it thick enough. Naturally, your shoulder joint isn't parallel to the floor. It's actually angled up about 15 or 20 degrees. And so that being said, this position tucked right into my side isn't very natural for my shoulder. You'll see that I can only rotate to about 0.45, maybe 50 degrees there. I should be able to take that through about 80 to 90 degrees of rotation. So what I'm going to do, let that stray from my side a little bit. And now, as I rotate, you'll see that I can rotate even a lot further with it. So don't be so concerned about pinning it down to your side. what I tell people is you need to be more concerned about how that resistance is traveling. Start with the band right here at your belly button and then when you finish I want you to finish with your hand higher than your belly button. Okay, so we start low and we finish high. And what we're doing there is we're ensuring that again that proper that about 15 degrees of rotation is maintained as we get out to the side. And so if your towel is too little it kind of pins your elbow",

You'll see that that's about 0-3 or 4 inches now. All of a sudden that becomes a lot more natural for me to rotate away from it. And so that's just a quick note on that towel. The other common error that I see is you start right in here at your side and then as you pull it out you want to get it all the way out there and so you'll see what I did. I just strained my elbow out and so again don't be so concerned about how far it's moving as you are about the quality of the motion. So to show you how to do it correctly, good posture, okay? So shoulders back, head high, chest high. You're gonna go that band. It's right across, it's just right about my belly button. My elbows bent to a 90 degree and then as I pull against that resistance, again, elbow can stray a little bit as long as that hand finishes higher. And so it looks just like this right here. What you'll do is 10 repetitions and you'll do that three sets. I want you to fill that right in the back, right in these little muscles right up here in the back of your shoulder.

This is a common symptom of tennis elbow [Video 1: Mtd0U13cfx0, Time: 00:46-00:50].\n\n2. **Assess Pain During Movement**: Extend your arm straight out and flex your wrist backward while applying pressure downwards. If this motion causes pain, it is indicative of tennis elbow [Video 2: Mtd0U13cfx0, Time: 01:05-01:11].\n\n3. **Consider Pain Onset**: Reflect on how the pain started. Tennis elbow often develops gradually due to repetitive motions, so consider your recent activities [Video 1].\n\n4. **Safety Note**: If you experience significant pain during these tests, it is advisable to stop the activity and consult a healthcare professional. Continuing to exert pressure on a painful area can exacerbate the condition.\n\nBy following these steps, you can better assess whether you may be experiencing tennis elbow. If symptoms persist, seek medical advice for a comprehensive evaluation.",

To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm. This type of mobilization technique will stretch out the wrists and mobilize it in different angles and prepare them to be able and be ready to support any awkward angles of weight that is going to be placed on them, for example handstands or even overhead weight movements such as Olympic weight lifting. Move side to side for about 20 to 30 reps and repeat it for the five times. Tennis elbow and golfer's elbow stretch. To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest.

Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there.

So still keeping your feet about shoulder with the part. You You want to keep your heels down on the ground and then push your bottom back as you squat down. So you want to keep those knees behind the toes. So not going down like this, but really sticking the bottom back only go down as far as you're comfortable. Again, if you feel like you have some balance issues, put a chair behind you. So if you feel like you're falling, you can just sit down in the chair. So nice and slow coming down and then coming back up. So again, just start off with about 10 of these. That's working those muscles to pump that fluid back up and then come down and slowly back up.

To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest. To stretch the forearm muscles for golfers elbow, you're going to exaggerate a very slow wave so that palm of your hand lands on the table top and bench where your fingers point backwards. Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

You may also feel tightness in the surrounding muscles [Video 1: Mtd0U13cfx0, Time: 00:46-00:50].\n\n2. **Arm Positioning**: Extend your arm straight out in front of you with your wrist in a neutral position. This is crucial for the next step [Video 2: Mtd0U13cfx0, Time: 01:05-01:11].\n\n3. **Apply Pressure**: With your other hand, apply downward pressure on the wrist while keeping your arm extended. If you experience pain during this motion, it may indicate tennis elbow [Video 2].\n\n4. **Wrist Stretch**: To further assess, place the back of your hand on a table or chair with your elbow straight. Lean backward gently until you feel a stretch in the back of your hand or wrist. Ensure this does not cause severe pain [Video 3: hJ3",

          "text": "a very slow wave so that palm of your hand lands on the table top and bench where your fingers point backwards. Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do have wrist pain, there's a good chance that the pain could be coming from the rotate cuff muscles and referring pain down into the wrist. Or if you suffer from golfers elbow or tennis elbow, the pain in their forearm can be referred down into wrist as well. So I highly recommend you check out my other videos. For example, the tennis elbow and golfers elbow must release technique video or check out my secret spot to fix the shoulder pain that could be referring down into your wrist.

So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

Usually it's in the outer part of the elbow and this region with pain extending down into the forearm and some tightness in the muscles there. Another thing to consider is how the pain started. So usually it happens with repetitive the use type injury like repeatedly gripping or twisting or pulling the wrist in extended position on the computer typing for long periods of time that can definitely cause some pain in that area. Another few things you can do hold your arm out apply some pressure to the middle finger with your wrist straight push down and resist that if you're pain in the form and and all about, then that's a good sign that you have tennis elbow. Another is to hold that arm out, the straight and extend the wrists. Apply some pressure down to the wrist there. If you find that you have pain with that motion as well, then that's another sign that you have tennis elbow. Another way to test yourself is to get a chair, nothing that's too heavy, but using the first three fingers, grasp the top of that chair lift with your elbow and wrist straight and see if that causes you that same kind of pain. If it does, again, you probably have tennis elbow. So if that's the case, if you think you have tennis elbow, check",

What that does is that pushes that shoulder blade down to kind of hold it and stabilize it because since that muscles connected to that shoulder blade, you want to hold it down to get the best stretch. So if this is painful, you don't have to do it, but that's the best way you're gonna get the stretch. Then you want to take your other hand a place that kind of behind your head and you're gonna pull down and towards the opposite knee. So you're not going straight down, you're not going out to the side, but almost not quite a 45 degree angle, but you're taking your head towards that opposite knee. So I'm just going up with my elbow on this side and then pulling down and across. And you should feel that stretch right in through there. And it should be a good kind of hurt so good feeling, but it shouldn't be painful at all.

Some people even just start by getting up on their elbow to get used to it but the key to this is not to have your pelvis come above the bed or the floor. That means that it's your back is so tight that it actually does need stretching. So you just work in the range that allows you. And then eventually you might be able to go up this far. If you're still coming off like this, go up to the point where it allows you to go and stop right there and go back down again.

Yeah, and this really works well. I think for a lot of people with that forward head posture. Yeah, and they're starting to get pain right where the neck meets the skull. Yeah, right where they're. And this, you know, quite often a lot of headaches come from that too. And by massaging that area, which you can do with circles, Brad's going to go ahead and show us some techniques. Can you hear me? Liz, can I get my money? Liz cannot hear you, so I will interpret Brad. So he's going to go ahead and do some circles, so you can see again he's working right underneath the skull there. Yeah, and he's in a good posture while he's doing this.

So with the quad stretch, you should feel it right through here. Some people feel it a little bit more in their knee, That could be because maybe that joint is tight as well. So if you're feeling it more in your knee versus in that quad muscle belly area, again, maybe you can't go as high, but try and bring that leg back just a little bit. And that should help get that muscle versus that knee joint. Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well.

Begin by placing the palm of your hand on a flat surface, such as a table or bench, with your fingers pointing backward. Ensure that your elbow is fully extended and straight. \n\nNext, lean backward slowly, using your body weight to apply gentle pressure. This motion should create a stretch in the inner part of your forearm and the back of your wrist, targeting the wrist flexor muscles. It's important to perform this stretch slowly and carefully to avoid any sudden movements that could exacerbate pain or injury. Hold the stretch for a few seconds, breathing deeply to help relax the muscles. \n\nIf you feel any sharp pain during the stretch, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. Always listen to your body and avoid pushing yourself too far to prevent further injury [Video 1: hJ3XICFLxvU, Time: 05:19-05:24].",

To stretch the wrist flexors, find a table or bench that plays the palm of your hand on top of the table and lean and body weight on them. This should create a slight stretch already. If you still don't feel the stretch, slightly lean forward with your body weight until you feel a slight stretch, the back of your wrist or in the inner portion of your forearm. Now if you don't feel any pain or severe pain, you are now ready to lean side to side. Nice and slow. This will mobilize the wrist and wrist extension and also stretch out the wrist flex muscle. To stretch the wrist extension, place the back of your hand on a table or a bench with your elbow, nice and straight and locked out. Now lean backwards with your body weight until you feel a stretch at the back of your hands or the back of your wrist. Once you feel comfortable and is no severe pain, just slowly move side to side in a controlled manner. This will mobilize the wrist joint inflection and also stretch out the wrist extensor muscles, which is located at the back of your forearm.

If you have not used crutches before, the first thing that you want to remember is they need to be fit properly for you. So I'm going to go through a couple of basics for that. The first thing that you can check on your crutches to see if there's a tool that will help you decide your height and where they should be at. This is kind of a reference only. So you want to get the whole set to where your height is as a general reference point. And then you're going to turn the crutches right side up. And when you stand nice and tall with the crutches at your side, when you hang your arms at your side, the wrist part should line up about with your wrist. So the your pad and your wrist are even. And if you put your hands on the pad, your elbow has a slight bend in it. The other thing to remember is that you should have a little bit of a gap between your armpit and the top of the crutch so that there are some space there. The first thing you want to remember if you're using crutches is not to lean your armpits onto the top of the pads because you can cause nerve damage that will affect the sensation",

Then remove at least three times the dead space from the arterial line. Clean the arterial line sampling port. Attach the blood gas syringe to the sampling port and collect the sample. gently tap the syringe so that air bubbles are forced to the top, expel air bubbles through the tip cap or into a gauze. Mix the sample thoroughly to dissolve the You can use a flush solution to make sure that the arterial line is clear of blood. Label the syringe with patient ID and immediately transport the sample to the blood gas analyzer.",

To stretch your wrist and forearm muscles for tennis elbow, start by drawing a circle with your index finger from the outside of your body, inwards. Now place the back of your hand on a bench in a rotated position. This will stretch a particular group of wrists and some muscles and tendons, they're affected by tennis elbow, also known as lateral hipic on the lightest. To stretch the forearm muscles for golfers elbow, you're going to exaggerate a very slow wave so that palm of your hand lands on the table top and bench where your fingers point backwards. Now if your elbow extended in um, nice and straight, lean backwards slowly and press in with your body weight. You should feel a stretch in the inner portion of your forearm and the back of your wrist. This will stretch the wrist flexor muscles and tendons that may be affected by a medial epiconolitis, also known as golfer's elbow. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and repeat it for the five times. You can do this on both arms as it will still mobilize and stretch the wrist. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

As the patient is been a wield in the operating room, the nursing staff report that the patient is late because they were not able to place an IV and they've had multiple attempts and difficulty and therefore they brought the patient to the operating room, albeit with them, delay. But by the time the patient is in the operating room and the operating bed, it's already 820 and the searches are now starting to fret about the delay the start of the day. Although this delay has nothing to do with you know, it is always an anesthesia delay. As the patient is positioned on the operating room table, you assess the patient's peripheral veins and now you see that there are traces of multiple attempts to increase the size and the visibility of the peripheral veins, we typically use turnicate and there are several different kinds of turnicate you can use, but the idea with the turnicate that you apply the compression around the arm or the leg so that the arterial inflow continues, but the Venus Adflow is prevented.

Ensure the surface is clean and stable.\n\n2. **Position Your Hands**: Place the palm of one hand on the table with your fingers pointing towards your body. This position targets the wrist flexors, which are essential for activities that involve wrist strain, such as gymnastics or weightlifting [Video 1: hJ3XICFLxvU, Time: 03:25-03:29].\n\n3. **Apply Weight**: Lean your body weight gently onto the hand resting on the table. This will deepen the stretch in your wrist flexors. Be careful not to apply too much pressure to avoid injury.\n\n4. **Alternate Stretch**: For a different stretch, point your fingers upwards while keeping your elbow straight. Use your other hand to gently pull back on the fingers of the stretching hand, enhancing the stretch [Video 2: hJ3XICFLxvU, Time: 02:44-02:48].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always listen to your body; if you feel pain rather than a gentle stretch, ease",

Yes, which you're going to find out how useful this can be for after surgery as well as before surgery. So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing",

Mike is filling on the in-force and we're happy to have him. and we're going to continue on in the title of this video is the best niece drink fitting exercise after surgery and that's including total knee, meniscus or ACL surgery plus the giveaway and the giveaway relates directly to this video or we have but yes you can check us out on Instagram, twitter and tiktok for a 60 second version of our program you can find the giveaway pinned to the top of our Facebook or go to bumbright.com slash giveaways to find out what it is. Giveaways the knee glide. Yes, which you're going to find out how useful this can be for after surgery as well as before surgery. So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works",

There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work. Yeah, you can use this on any flooring you want these, you've made prototypes, and I first started working for you, and we've been tested these things out for years now. It's been about eight years, they're completely perfected. Now, the other thing that works that you cannot get with a towel is you can put them on an incline. Now, you're going to start doing range of motion after surgery. Oftentimes, it's a very next day. You've got to get that joint moving. There will be maybe some instances where that's not the case, but total need is almost always. And this works great. Your knee hurts at sore, but you got to get it moving. and you get it going and on the flat. Now, Mike has his at an angle where he's gonna emphasize the hamstring strength. This might not be early on, this would be more for strength and then later on down the river. Maybe a couple of weeks, three weeks down the road. As you can do it this way, we find that when you put it on an incline, this direction works really well right after that,",

Because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here, sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well. So if you feel like your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain through there when you're stretching, then go ahead and hold off because if you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on. So it should be painful you should just feel tension with the stretch as you're stretching through it one your timer is complete so there you have it those where you're standing quad stretches remember this is a part of my office stretching series real-time stretches from head to toe so if you want to check out some more of those make sure you click on the link up here and if you would like to support my channel find out how by clicking on the link up here and don't forget to subscribe by clicking down",

      "answer": "To use a knee glide effectively for regaining motion after knee surgery, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Place the knee glide on a flat surface or an incline. Using an incline may facilitate better movement due to changes in the ankle joint angle, which can enhance the effectiveness of the exercise [Video 2: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 02:56-02:58].\n\n2. **Initiate Movement**: Start moving your knee gently on the glide. It's essential to begin this process as soon as possible after surgery, often the next day, to promote mobility and prevent stiffness [Video 2].\n\n3. **Use of Strong Leg**: If you experience difficulty, you can use your strong leg to assist in moving the affected leg. This method provides passive range of motion and can help ease the movement [Video 3: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 03:34-03:35].\n\n4. **Monitor Pain Levels**: While using the knee glide, be aware of any pain. It is normal to feel soreness, but if the pain becomes severe, stop the exercise and consult your healthcare provider.\n\n5. **Consistency**: Regular use of the knee",

Your knee hurts at sore, but you got to get it moving. and you get it going and on the flat. Now, Mike has his at an angle where he's gonna emphasize the hamstring strength. This might not be early on, this would be more for strength and then later on down the river. Maybe a couple of weeks, three weeks down the road. As you can do it this way, we find that when you put it on an incline, this direction works really well right after that, first week after surgery. For one thing, you're going downhill, makes it easier. It changes the angle of the ankle joint. And for some reason, we're not 100% certain, but we always have better luck when you put it on an incline if someone's having problems. We have the patient go like this with their strong leg, put a little passive range. We always find that people get better range when they do the pressure versus the therapist going on their question. She's shoving it in the right. Because they're not in control. then people don't feel comfortable and somebody else is in control of a painful joint. Mike, you got some more comments on that aspect of the knee glide? Yeah, flat is okay to do. I",

I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now. The therapist will come into the therapist room and they'll take a towel and throw it down and say wax the floor and that works okay. There's nothing wrong with that, but there can be better and there is, and what we found, and actually what we invented is the knee glide, because with the knee glide, the benefits are, it works great on a flat surface, you don't need a towel, and on carpeting at home, if you put the towel down, it does not work.

We have the patient go like this with their strong leg, put a little passive range. We always find that people get better range when they do the pressure versus the therapist going on their question. She's shoving it in the right. Because they're not in control. then people don't feel comfortable and somebody else is in control of a painful joint. Mike, you got some more comments on that aspect of the knee glide? Yeah, flat is okay to do. I feel like when I get here, it gets tied on my ankles. I just have tight ankles because I've sprained them both, but just having that little bit of an incline really helps be able to bring it back there without having that ankle issues. So. And then going uphill direction does put a little more emphasis on quad strength. So that's another benefit. The other really nice thing about it is you can use this for pre-hab. So before surgery, we have some surgeons and people that will use it prior. So they get used to the equipment, it get that knee moving. And to be honest with you, people say, I use this more.

So, uh, there's, uh, last I looked over 800,000 total knee replacements. I don't have the number for ACL and miniscule surgeries, but they're well into the hundreds of thousands. So there's a great need for rehab, rehabbing the knee, prior to surgery, and after the surgery, typically what has been done in the past is now.

Drawing an arterial blood gas sample is not as difficult as you may think. Since arteries pulsate, they are easier to locate and unlike some veins, arteries don't roll. Simulate drawing blood using the Venopunkshire trainer and follow these steps as if in a real clinical situation. Before starting with the procedure, ensure that you have greeted the patient, introduce yourself, and pause to confirm that you have positively identified the correct patient and that you are performing the correct procedure. You have performed an Allen's test and the result was negative. Start by opening a clean work surface cover, then gather, open, and assemble the relevant items and equipment on the cover, tear open an alcohol prep swab sashay. It is important to position the arm correctly. The patient should be seated comfortably, patients in bed should be in the semi-recombat position. With the arm comfortably extended toward you, wrist up, and extended with the skin over the radial artery taught. Perform hand hygiene, dawn sterile gloves, and disinfect the site with an alcohol wipe for 30 seconds, and allow it to dry completely for another 30 seconds. With the fingertips of your gloved left hand, find the area of maximal pulsation of the radial artery. You should be able to feel not just the pulsation, but also the radial artery as a core-like structure beneath your fingers. Visualize the course of the radial artery underneath your fingers in",

      "answer": "To use a knee glide for hamstring strength after surgery, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Ensure you have a knee glide, which is designed for post-surgery rehabilitation. It can be used effectively on flat surfaces, and avoid using it on carpet as it may not work properly [Video 3].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Sit comfortably on a flat surface with your knee glide positioned beneath your knee. Make sure the glide is stable and secure.\n\n3. **Movement**: Begin by gently sliding your heel backward on the glide, allowing your knee to bend. This motion helps improve range of motion and engages the hamstrings. It's important to start slowly to avoid pain or discomfort [Video 1: lfhDPB8LaTk, Time: 02:56-02:58].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Perform this movement in a controlled manner, gradually increasing the range as tolerated. Aim for multiple repetitions, but listen to your body and stop if you experience significant pain.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting any rehabilitation exercises post-surgery to ensure they are appropriate for your specific condition [Video 2].\n\nUsing the knee glide can significantly aid in recovery",
