Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So it actually stops that large inward curve in you like that. So lying down in this position. Coming down, now your forehead needs to be in contact with the ground, your arms are down and your palm are facing downwards. So I mean that position, now your head stays in contact with the ground during the whole exercise. The first exercise is to pull the shoulders away from the ears. Now can you try that at home or wherever you are? Head down, pull the shoulders away from your ears and then actually start to activate those lower trapezius muscles I was showing you on the diagram for earlier. Now second step is pull your shoulders away from your ears, squeeze your shoulders together and lift your hands just off the ground and now lower them down slowly and relax. Now you already know if you're doing this thing correctly. If you tend to be tight through upper traps, this is what you'll do. You'll lift and you'll pull up that way and",

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Ensure your upper body is stable and supported by your arms. Avoid letting your head drop forward, as this can create a neck hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n2. **Chin Tuck**: Gently tuck your chin in towards your neck. Imagine creating a double chin without moving your head forward or backward. This helps to align your cervical spine and reduce strain on your neck.\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain the chin tuck for a few seconds while feeling the tension in the muscles at the back of your neck. This is crucial for strengthening the neck muscles and improving posture.\n\n4. **Release**: After holding the position, slowly release the tuck and return to the neutral position. \n\n5. **Repetition**: Repeat this exercise several times throughout the day, especially if you spend long periods in front of a computer.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that your upper body is stable and avoid any forward head movement to prevent exacerbating neck issues [Video 1].",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the",

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times.

Squeeze your shoulder blades together and back. The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Ensure your head is in a neutral position.\n\n2. **Hand Placement**: Place your hand on the side of your forehead, specifically on the temple area. This will help provide resistance during the exercise.\n\n3. **Executing the Retraction**: While keeping your shoulders down, gently push your head into your hand. It's important to note that your head should not actually move; the resistance from your hand will create the necessary tension. This motion helps engage the muscles around your scapula and neck [Video 1: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 08:47-08:52].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Perform this motion in a controlled manner, aiming for several repetitions. If you experience pain or discomfort, reduce the intensity or stop the exercise.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you feel significant pain while performing this exercise, it's advisable to consult a healthcare professional before continuing. Always listen to your body and adjust as needed to avoid injury.",

And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one out is this one's going to be a little bit differently so again you're going to use your arm but this time is going to go up so you can either just raise your arm or I like to kind of put it back this way where my elbows kind of pointing up towards this healing. So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times.

So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand.

And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

This helps to maintain proper posture throughout the stretch.\n\n2. **Hand Placement**: Place one hand on the side of your forehead, specifically on the temple area. This positioning is crucial for the next step.\n\n3. **Applying Pressure**: Gently push your head against your hand. It's important to note that while you are applying pressure, your head should not actually move. This isometric contraction helps to engage the neck muscles without straining them [Video 1: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 08:47-08:52].\n\n4. **Duration**: Hold the pressure for a few seconds, then relax.

This will help prevent you from further injuring yourself, especially if you're recovering for a broken clavicle. Begin by unfolding the brace and laying it flat, to identify the left and right straps. I'm doing the Velcro closures on the ends of the straps. I have the person helping you position the felt back pad behind your shoulder blades with the plastic triangle pointing down. Have them carefully wrap the left strap over your left shoulder and under your armpit. They should feed the end of the left strap through the left side of the plastic triangle buckle and attach the Velcro closure. Repeat this process with the right strap. The brace should now be in a figure 8 shape. To adjust Just the fit, the person helping to pull the straps tighter or loosen the straps until your desired level of clavicle or posture support is",

To give With your domino thrust, stand behind them, put your arms around them and link your hands between their tummy button and the bottom of their chest. Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives. If they become unresponsive, open the airway and check their breathing. If they're not breathing normally, start CPR. So remember, if someone's choking, cough it out, slap it out, squeeze it out.

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

The brace is designed in a figure-eight pattern that wraps around both shoulders, which helps to stabilize the clavicle area after a fracture. This design is specifically beneficial for keeping the shoulders back, which aids in maintaining proper alignment and immobilization of the collarbone during the healing process.\n\nWhile the video does not provide detailed step-by-step instructions on how to physically put on the brace, it emphasizes the importance of the brace in mobilizing the clavicle area and supporting healing after a break or fracture. The brace is particularly useful for individuals engaged in high-impact sports, where clavicle injuries are common. \n\nIn summary, the clavicle brace is essential for stabilizing the collarbone and facilitating recovery, but specific application instructions are not detailed in the provided video evidence [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 00:46-00:49].",

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder.

And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Coming down, now your forehead needs to be in contact with the ground, your arms are down and your palm are facing downwards. So I mean that position, now your head stays in contact with the ground during the whole exercise. The first exercise is to pull the shoulders away from the ears. Now can you try that at home or wherever you are? Head down, pull the shoulders away from your ears and then actually start to activate those lower trapezius muscles I was showing you on the diagram for earlier. Now second step is pull your shoulders away from your ears, squeeze your shoulders together and lift your hands just off the ground and now lower them down slowly and relax. Now you already know if you're doing this thing correctly. If you tend to be tight through upper traps, this is what you'll do. You'll lift and you'll pull up that way and",

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if",

This position allows for better access to the submental area.\n\n3. **Palpation Technique**: Stand behind the patient and use your fingers to gently palpate the submental region, which is located just below the chin. Apply light pressure to feel for any enlarged or tender lymph nodes.\n\n4. **Assessment**: Note the size, consistency, and tenderness of any lymph nodes you palpate. Document your findings for further evaluation.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: After the examination, ensure the patient is comfortable and address any questions they may have regarding the procedure.\n\nAlways prioritize patient comfort and safety throughout the examination process.",

Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the",

And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is",

So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button down below and you can always find me at askdoctorjo.com. So we're going to start off with some stretches and then we'll move into the exercises towards the end. So the first stretch is an upper trap stretch. A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching",

It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all.

Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable.

Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break.

And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key. So I'm going to go through a couple steps and show you exactly how this is done. I also want to tell you that this far is protected where and gear. Some people will deck out in everything including a gown, gloves, mask. I sheelts, typically in my setting the respiratory therapist, text, doctor's nurses. We all just put all the pair of gloves. If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face",

You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt.

And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome.

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

Many of us are so concerned about right here, here and here and here and here. However, we forget about the scalp. But think about it. Scum and the face is connected. In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started!

If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

But I have a dry mouth issue. That's the second part, part two of this video and podcast. The saga that's going on in our house as well. It's on the redsworld. Yeah. So the thing about dry mouth is the medical term is Zerostomia. Is there a stormy? I don't know, stormy, I mean, it's opening. Yep. And I didn't look up Zara as probably a Latin word. And it's one of those words that tricky because it starts with the X, but it sounds like a Z. That kind of thing bothers me, so if you're an English major out there and you know why they do that, I wanna comment or to explaining that. So Zara, stormy, a dry mouth,",

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down.

And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one out is this one's going to be a little bit differently so again you're going to use your arm but this time is going to go up so you can either just raise your arm or I like to kind of put it back this way where my elbows kind of pointing up towards this healing. So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed. So you want to go down as far as you're able to go, just letting gravity take it. From there what I do is wing my elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my head. This will create a passive stretch into the upper back, and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click, or crack. Again, that is just gas is being released from the joints. You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level.",

Yeah, put pressure on the specific nerve. And that nerve will send symptoms, wherver that nerve tracks, and here they go down into the way. And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if",

Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs. Where are from the back to the legs are you getting a pinch of hair and which we use you call sciatica sure The other thing we thought we talked about a couple fun ones right, Brad With this some names out there for nerves that could pinched and these are the ones that are generally more of a tempered pinch But what does call serenity policy?

Doctor of physical therapy, tone and time, and in this video I want to share with you five of the best core strengthening exercises for your sciatic nerve pain. What is sciatic and well-explained or numbness or can you leave them run down the back your leg? Most of the time caused by some problem of your your core back. If we can teach you the right strengthening and stabilization exercises to help minimize some of that problem, you're going to feel a lot better. That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

We know how L5 was down at the top of your foot if you feel symptoms there, right? So where you're having the pain, it could be where you're having the pinched nerve but quite often it isn't. It's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here kind of trying to kind of investigate of the job trying to figure out where the problem is coming from.

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

This compression can lead to symptoms like pain or discomfort in these regions [Video 1: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time: 02:29-02:34].\n\n2. **Observe Symptoms**: Pay attention to any pain, tingling, or numbness that radiates from your neck into your shoulder. These symptoms may indicate nerve compression.\n\n3. **Perform a Physical Test**: A specific test can help determine if the nerve compression is causing your shoulder pain. While the video does not detail the exact test, it suggests that a clinical assessment is necessary to evaluate the symptoms accurately.\n\n4. **Consult a Healthcare Professional**: If you suspect a pinched nerve, it is crucial to seek medical advice.

Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives.

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button down below and you can always find me at askdoctorjo.com. So we're going to start off with some stretches and then we'll move into the exercises towards the end. So the first stretch is an upper trap stretch. A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

Yeah, put pressure on the specific nerve. And that nerve will send symptoms, wherver that nerve tracks, and here they go down into the way. And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if",

And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is",

So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button down below and you can always find me at askdoctorjo.com. So we're going to start off with some stretches and then we'll move into the exercises towards the end. So the first stretch is an upper trap stretch. A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching",

And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome.

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

And sometimes what they have you do is slide to the bottom of this finger and then go back. Start again. If you've got a itch on your finger, you could itch it with your hand like that. Oh, again, surprisingly, Brad, if you do it, when you don't use the hand a lot in that certain fashion, the hand actually gets tired. Yeah, I can feel those muscles working on. It was no doubt about it. All right, next one. It's the timer, right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's right. OK. Next one, we're going to go ahead and last one. You're going to do what we call finger abduction. So you're bringing the finger out like this. Now that my hand is warmed up from the wax lab, I'm going to try with this hand. Oh, look at that.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome.

The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from.

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

Then I also want you to try to lift your legs up off of the floor. I want your knees to get up off of the ground. So this is what it looks like, right? Chest and knees come up off of the floor. And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a",

So this time around what I'm going to do is take my arms off like this. Create like a field goal position with my arms. Let my head go down towards the floor. And then just wing the elbows down towards the floor. What this will do is it stretches the chest, opens the pack up just a little bit differently. And that might get it to finally self release or pop. But challenge yourself to bring the elbows down as much as you can. You can hold this stretch for 15 to 20 seconds. Relax and then repeat. You can also do what our known as floor angels. So go down all the way right here. Lower the hands down towards, or I should say the back side are going to be towards the floor. And then from there I'm going to wing my elbows down as much as I can. and then just raise my arms overhead just like this. You'll feel, again, the muscles just get hit a little bit differently, and that might just help. If you feel like it still needs a little bit more attention, you can put a",

We've lowered the patient down to the floor carefully using good ergonomics ourselves, protecting the patient's head and protecting them from trauma from them crashing to the floor. If we've not already called 911 or called the code, now is the time to do so. Once they're on the floor, we go straight into our chest compressions. We may notice that we have actually put on gloves because I know I'm going to be trying to pull an object out of the mouth if I've actually gotten one up and into the mouth. So it's good time to put your gloves on if you haven't already and have a CPR shield available and ready to use with a one-way valve. Keep in note here that when we do these chest thross or chest compressions, we're going to be going to a depth of 2 to 2.4 inches deep and we're going to do it at a rate between 100 and 120 times per minute. We're going to give our first 30 chance compressions, elbows locked, leaning over the victims chest, using our upper body weight to do the chest compression. One in, two in, three in, four in, five in, six in, seven in, eight, nine in, ten, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. After my 30 chance compressions, I head to chin lift, I open up the mouth.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down.

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated.

Let's just do a few of these just warm it on a feeling good It's a happy day. Let's get those hips moving. Here we go work it, you're stretching your obliques right here, a little bit of the gluteus minimus. We have a maximus, we have a minimus. Let's give it a little attention here. All right, so the 1990 means that your front knee is going to be at 90 degrees and your back is also. So let's go ahead and bring, you can do the near image of what I do. So I'm bringing my left foot forward, you bring your right foot forward. Just like this, so we see a 90 degrees here, we see a 90 degrees here and we're straight up. So we're going to start with a stretch. You're going to lean back here and you're going to feel stretch in that joint capsule. Okay, ooh that is a good stretch where we're going to do three different stretches and then we'll do the exercises that we're pulsing into that end-range motion. Just lean back feel that bring that leg back a little bit further if you can just so it comes straight off from",

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Let's just do a few of these just warm it on a feeling good It's a happy day. Let's get those hips moving. Here we go work it, you're stretching your obliques right here, a little bit of the gluteus minimus. We have a maximus, we have a minimus. Let's give it a little attention here. All right, so the 1990 means that your front knee is going to be at 90 degrees and your back is also. So let's go ahead and bring, you can do the near image of what I do. So I'm bringing my left foot forward, you bring your right foot forward. Just like this, so we see a 90 degrees here, we see a 90 degrees here and we're straight up. So we're going to start with a stretch. You're going to lean back here and you're going to feel stretch in that joint capsule. Okay, ooh that is a good stretch where we're going to do three different stretches and then we'll do the exercises that we're pulsing into that end-range motion. Just lean back feel that bring that leg back a little bit further if you can just so it comes straight off from",

I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot. Instead of on the outside of my right knee, that's what a full plank looks like, a full side plank. Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower",

If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated.

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated.

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

It could also also be a bit of osteoarthritis, you need to be really a bit older for that, maybe having had a drum and a past in your shoulder, a lot of grinding goes on, I'm not talking about the occasional clicking when you move your arm, but it's the grinding stuff, that is a bit of a telltale sign as well as osteoarthritis, and you can have an appingement, an appingement is actually one of the tendons within the shoulder joint in the area, which get impeached. So when your shoulder decreases its space and the tendon becomes stuck essentially. Now the test you can do for that on the right side is literally put your right hand on your left shoulder and then raise your arm up. This is so then you've most likely got an impingement in the shoulder itself or you can do the drop arm test where the arm is, you lift the arm up using the other hand or the way up and you bring it down and the drop arm test means you get to",

This engages the muscles and joints in your fingers. Hold this position for a few seconds before relaxing. Repeat this several times to build initial strength.\n\n2. **Isolate Joint Movement**: Focus on one joint at a time. For example, hold the base of your finger (the metacarpophalangeal joint) with one hand while attempting to bend the finger at the knuckle. This helps target the specific joint and improve its flexibility and strength. You may find that you can only bend it partially at first, which is okay; progress at your own pace [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:47-04:48].\n\n3. **Consistency is Key**: Perform these exercises regularly, ideally multiple times a day, to see gradual improvement.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience pain or discomfort during these exercises, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional.

With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated.

Once again, should be a straight line, nose and belly button between my knees, down between my ankles. Now, we're really trying to engage these core muscles. You can actually draw your belly button and while you're holding this exercise, just to create exercise for lateral stability. You're gonna hold this for 20 to 30 seconds. And then you're gonna repeat that at three times on each side. Next, let's do a little more focus or come on that lower back specifically. This is going to be, well, in planning, it's called being swimmer, so we call these swimmer. So that's what I refer to in my clinic. You're going to lay down on your stomach with your legs, well, legs out straight, your arms extended above you, right here. Similar to a bird dog, I'm going to lift my right arm up off the floor at the same time, lift my left leg off with the floor and then return to the starting position and then repeat left arm right leg and so these swimmers looks just like this just another very way that we can stabilize that lower",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

Let's just do a few of these just warm it on a feeling good It's a happy day. Let's get those hips moving. Here we go work it, you're stretching your obliques right here, a little bit of the gluteus minimus. We have a maximus, we have a minimus. Let's give it a little attention here. All right, so the 1990 means that your front knee is going to be at 90 degrees and your back is also. So let's go ahead and bring, you can do the near image of what I do. So I'm bringing my left foot forward, you bring your right foot forward. Just like this, so we see a 90 degrees here, we see a 90 degrees here and we're straight up. So we're going to start with a stretch. You're going to lean back here and you're going to feel stretch in that joint capsule. Okay, ooh that is a good stretch where we're going to do three different stretches and then we'll do the exercises that we're pulsing into that end-range motion. Just lean back feel that bring that leg back a little bit further if you can just so it comes straight off from",

This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release.

      "answer": "To strengthen your fingers after an injury, stroke, or cast removal, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Start with Flexion**: Begin by flexing all your fingers completely. This involves curling your fingers into your palm as much as possible. If you can only bend them partially, that\u2019s okay\u2014work within your range of motion [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:47-04:48].\n\n2. **Isolate Joints**: For more advanced strengthening, focus on isolating one joint at a time. Hold one joint steady while trying to bend the adjacent joints. This targeted approach can help improve flexibility and strength in specific areas of your fingers.\n\n3. **Gradual Progression**: As you become more comfortable with the movements, gradually increase the range of motion. It\u2019s important to listen to your body and not push through pain.\n\n4. **Consistency**: Perform these exercises regularly, aiming for multiple times a day if possible, to see improvement over time.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise regimen, especially following an injury, to ensure that these exercises are appropriate for your specific condition.",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated.

      "answer": "To strengthen your fingers after an injury, stroke, or cast removal, you can practice touching each finger to your thumb. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Start Position**: Begin with your hand in a relaxed position, fingers extended and thumb pointing upward.\n2. **Touch the Thumb**: Bring your index finger to touch the tip of your thumb. If you find it difficult, you may only be able to go partway; that\u2019s okay. Focus on what you can do comfortably [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:47-04:48].\n3. **Progress to Other Fingers**: After successfully touching the thumb with your index finger, repeat the process with your middle finger, ring finger, and pinky finger, ensuring to return to the starting position after each touch.\n4. **Flexibility and Movement**: As you progress, try to flex your fingers completely while maintaining contact with the thumb. This will help improve both strength and flexibility.\n5. **Listen to Your Body**: If you experience pain or discomfort, stop and rest. It\u2019s important to work within your limits and gradually increase the range of motion as your strength improves.\n\nThis exercise",

We've lowered the patient down to the floor carefully using good ergonomics ourselves, protecting the patient's head and protecting them from trauma from them crashing to the floor. If we've not already called 911 or called the code, now is the time to do so. Once they're on the floor, we go straight into our chest compressions. We may notice that we have actually put on gloves because I know I'm going to be trying to pull an object out of the mouth if I've actually gotten one up and into the mouth. So it's good time to put your gloves on if you haven't already and have a CPR shield available and ready to use with a one-way valve. Keep in note here that when we do these chest thross or chest compressions, we're going to be going to a depth of 2 to 2.4 inches deep and we're going to do it at a rate between 100 and 120 times per minute. We're going to give our first 30 chance compressions, elbows locked, leaning over the victims chest, using our upper body weight to do the chest compression. One in, two in, three in, four in, five in, six in, seven in, eight, nine in, ten, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. After my 30 chance compressions, I head to chin lift, I open up the mouth. I look in the oral cavity to see if I've gotten anything up out of",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch.

This is so then you've most likely got an impingement in the shoulder itself or you can do the drop arm test where the arm is, you lift the arm up using the other hand or the way up and you bring it down and the drop arm test means you get to a stage where it gets really sore and you actually can't keep it up, you can't keep the arm up itself, we need to go, oh like that, you have this painful arc, that's a positive sign as well for an arrangement. So first thing we need to know, what's actually causing your shoulder problems, then we can help it, there's a few things we can do for you to help, there's a few bits, can do as well to help. There will be videos coming out, you can do as well, so stay tuned. Good luck with this. Thank you. Bye for now. Bye-bye.",

Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this.

Now if you do have a little back pain and there could be a chance that you're getting it from flat feet or even both legs and it's stopping you from getting out of bed or doing daily tasks. Please check out my three exercises for acute lower back pain. The video will definitely help you get moving again and also prevent lower back pain. I still do those exercises on the daily. Now, if you do have flat feet, there could be a chance that you do have both legs, not knees, where your knees move inwards and you might want to do some exercises to prevent that or improve that, so you don't get the general change and promote flat feet. Please check out my both leg video. The video will definitely help you out. Now remember to support this channel, hit subscribe, hit like, comment below if you have any questions and I'll see you guys in the next one.",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

          "text": "Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields. Welcome to Day 5 of your 360 breathing. Today, I'd like you to either sit down with no back or stand up. I'm going to stand. You can go cross-legged on the ground also. Let's start with some breathing through your nose, with some massage on either side of your nose. Do some circular motions here. You know, this nose needs to be open. Sometimes I'll have people do breathing exercise just holding open like that. Let's get them open, just by doing some massage, do some deep massage, get a little vigorous with it. Today, we are going to do 478 breathing. You're going to do four seconds in, seven second, hold, and eight second out. 478 breathing. It's a good one. It helps balance out the nervous system kind of defrazzly. Give you a clear palate. So your nervous system is ready to function the way it needs to function. Go out a little bit, let's get that face. anything connected to the nose, let's get it open, good. Okay, now let's open the lungs a little bit in the back, right? 360 is 360 degree all the way around. So we're gonna take the hands like this, push the palms together, curl forward, take a big breath in through the back body, feel it tighten up, breathing out, Pushing the hands even harder together good now we're going to come back we're in a class that the hands together like this take a big breath in. Breathe out",

So the first thing you're going to do is put on a turning kit, So we have to look for a vein, and the turning kit is going to go, this is going to increase to the elbow, it's going to go about three to four inches above it, and once you put time to turn it, show our exhibition if it's too tight, and then that's the patient to pop their fist a couple times, and she's going to pop it, we'll pop it in is where she's going to just feel for a vein, and the vein will bounce back on her fingers that sure know that's a good thing. So you never go by site, you always go by touch to feel for a vein. And he has a pretty good vein right in the middle and this is the vein that we this is the first vein that we use in full army. And then just choice two and three. Once he has popated, she's going to clean the area and there is a proper way of cleaning the area which you're going to do is you're going to start from",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a",

Ensure your shoulders are relaxed and down. \n\n2. **Hand Placement**: Place your hand on the side of your forehead, specifically on the temple area. This will be your point of resistance.\n\n3. **Engagement**: Gently push your head into your hand while keeping your head still. This action creates tension in the upper back area, which is essential for the release process [Video 1: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 08:47-08:52].\n\n4. **Release**: After holding the push for a moment, slowly return to the center. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, let your shoulder drop and release any tension. This should feel like a good pain, indicating a release of tension [Video 2: B9yiDTONlOs, Time: 01:56-02:00].\n\n5. **Side Variation**: Repeat the process on the other side to ensure balanced relief. Notice any differences in tension or heaviness between sides.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades. And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement. Of course, if you're interested in checking out that first video of those stretches and mobilizations to help your sciatic nerve feel better, check it out. I've got a",

Exercise number two is one of my favorite stabilization exercises for your lower back. This is going to be a verb dog. We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most.

So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed. So you want to go down as far as you're able to go, just letting gravity take it. From there what I do is wing my elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my head. This will create a passive stretch into the upper back, and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click, or crack. Again, that is just gas is being released from the joints. You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level.",

To focus a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y stretch.

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can.

There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll them forward so they're really good at creating neck pain. The middle traps actually squeeze the shoulder blades together. And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym",

What you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little bit differently. So experiment with different angles. Go all the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the left. If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

And again, hold that for about 30 seconds. So that's exercise number one. Y-W-T-L, really good exercise to get rid of that. That was just hump in the back of your neck. The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before",

Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

Maintain this stretch for a moment, then slowly return to the center [Video 2: B9yiDTONlOs, Time: 01:56-02:00].\n\n4. **Switch Sides**: After a few breaths, repeat the process on the opposite side.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades.

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

This will help you apply gentle pressure during the stretch [Video 1: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 08:47-08:52].\n\n3. **Stretching Motion**: While keeping your shoulders down, gently push your head into your hand.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades. And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

To focus a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y stretch.

Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one out is this one's going to be a little bit differently so again you're going to use your arm but this time is going to go up so you can either just raise your arm or I like to kind of put it back this way where my elbows kind of pointing up towards this healing. So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

Ensure your head is in a neutral position, not tilted forward or backward.\n\n2. **Hand Placement**: Place your hand on the side of your forehead, specifically on the temple area. This will provide resistance during the exercise.\n\n3. **Engagement**: Gently push your head into your hand while keeping your shoulders down. It\u2019s important to maintain the position of your head without moving it forward or backward. This creates tension in the neck and upper back area, which can help release tightness [Video 1: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 08:47-08:52].\n\n4. **Breathing**: As you push, take a deep inhale, and then exhale while allowing your shoulder to relax. This can enhance the feeling of release and help you notice any differences in tension on either side [Video 2: B9yiDTONlOs, Time: 01:56-02:00].\n\n5. **Safety Note**: If you experience pain that feels sharp or excessive, stop the exercise immediately.",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one out is this one's going to be a little bit differently so again you're going to use your arm but this time is going to go up so you can either just raise your arm or I like to kind of put it back this way where my elbows kind of pointing up towards this healing. So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

Keep your shoulders down and your head in a neutral position. Place your hand on the side of your forehead, specifically at the temple area, and gently push into your hand. This action engages your neck muscles without moving your head, allowing for a controlled extension of the upper back [Video 1: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 08:47-08:52].\n\nAs you engage in this exercise, pay attention to how your body feels. After completing the movement, slowly return to the center and take a deep breath. Inhale deeply and then exhale while allowing your shoulder to relax. This process helps in releasing tension and can lead to a noticeable difference in how your upper back feels [Video 2: B9yiDTONlOs, Time: 01:56-02:00]. \n\nIn summary, by using your hand to create resistance while keeping your head stable, you can effectively perform dynamic movements that may provide instant relief from upper back pain.",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Please check out my three exercises for acute lower back pain. The video will definitely help you get moving again and also prevent lower back pain. I still do those exercises on the daily. Now, if you do have flat feet, there could be a chance that you do have both legs, not knees, where your knees move inwards and you might want to do some exercises to prevent that or improve that, so you don't get the general change and promote flat feet. Please check out my both leg video. The video will definitely help you out.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from. Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it and if this is so then most likely you've got a tear in one of the rotator of muscles go to superspannators. The other test we can do for another muscle part of the rotator cuff is the infraspanators and what you do the test you do to test if you have a tear and this muscle is you put your elbow into your side you turn your arm out a little bit you hold it here and with the other hand you pull and you see if this inflicts you a pain in your shoulder. If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch.

There's a lot of benefits to you for that, because that means we only have to treat the portion of the tooth that gives you a the cosmetic benefit of changing the shade and the shape of the tooth, and be getting rid of the decay that's there. And so most of the time, we can do both of those things with something that's much less aggressive. Crowns are just too aggressive, almost always. So if your dentist is recommended at Crown, I would encourage you to maybe ask them why they feel that they feel that they need a crown and if it really comes down to the fact that you need a temporary, or they need to send it off to a lab, then I'd be concerned with that. You ought to seek out a dentist that has technology because it's been around for a while that allows us to fix the tooth and one visit and save more of your tooth structure. Avoid all those challenges and problems that I listed earlier about, you know, tooth pain, less of your tooth around. I mean, I think about it, if you're like a 35 year old and you're getting your tooth cut on to put a crown on it, that crown made the last you 20 years, but in 20 years you're gonna need another crown and when they cut that old one off, there's gonna be even less tooth structure there. So each time you're getting this tooth",

You know, cool, I've got, you made me understand why I don't need a crown, but what am I supposed to do? I believe that most dentists that are really providing the most conservative care are going to be comfortable doing three-quarter crowns or partial crowns that don't cut down the backside of the tooth. And they will also be able to do veneers. and veneers are just maybe similar to a three-quarter pound, maybe even a little more conservative than that in their prep. These are great ways to avoid long-term challenges or problems with your teeth. So I would encourage you to go to a dentist who has the ability to create same-day restorations. That'll be a big benefit to you. And go to a dentist who understands how to prepare teeth for veneers and doesn't require or recommend crowns when the backside of the tooth is healthy. The topic of this video came up from just this last week. I had a patient come in and had some concerns with their smile and wanted to improve it. And they came to me and they were fairly young and they were recommended to have. I believe it was like 20 crowns performed and prepped on their teeth. And they were very young. Obviously it's a big concern to me. I advise",

So we're really treating the tooth based off of our necessity to put a temporary on it. Now fast forward, right? The technology's come a long way. And now we can actually make the crown while in one visit, while you are here. And we don't require a lab to make the restoration anymore. So since we don't need a lab, you can imagine we don't have to have a temporary, and since we don't need a temporary, we don't have to shape the tooth the same way. There's a lot of benefits to you for that, because that means we only have to treat the portion of the tooth that gives you a the cosmetic benefit of changing the shade and the shape of the tooth, and be getting rid of the decay that's there.

Chances are if you've gone to your dentist or been concerned about having your front teeth addressed from tooth decay or even just not pleased with the way that they look, you may have been advised to get crowns done on your front teeth. There's some reasons why I would encourage a patient not to go down that route. Most of the time, we can avoid that. First, they're too aggressive. So when you are cutting on a tooth to prepare it for a crown, you have to remove almost all of the enamel. And this leaves the tooth more susceptible to fracture, more subtler break. It also would make the tooth likely to have more sensitivity and maybe even need a root canal in the future. So when you crown a tooth and you cut all the enamel away, it's definitely more likely to be a problem down the road. And you might ask yourself, so why in the world do we have to cut all the way around the tooth? And one of the reasons that we do that is for decades, we've not really had another solution to making the tooth have some sort of temporary why the lab makes your crown.

And that sounds okay except for the the fact that long term, this causes your lower teeth to get more wear and it's also likely to have wear on the backside of your restoration or chipping or breaking the crown over time because of the way that the bite connects. So hopefully that makes sense but that's one reason, that's this really the second reason why I would avoid crowns is that it changes the bite surface of your natural teeth to a prosthetic and it's really in an area that that's not super beneficial for you. Maybe even a third reason why you might want to avoid having a crown done on a front tooth. You've heard of the reason we would typically do a crown as to make it stronger, help hold a tooth together that's had a lot of decay or old restorations. And we would put the crown on top. And we put it on top and you have chewing forces like this. It's going, the crown's going to actually be giving that tooth additional strength. The fact that that tooth doesn't have a mammal there anymore is not too damaging, considering the forces this way. Now, if you take a front tooth, so you have a tooth in front where you, your forces really are more of this type of chewing forces where you go like that and you have",

So each time you're getting this tooth treated, you're more likely to have it break, hurt, and have problems for you down the road. So just avoid crowns if you can, almost never needed. In dental school, we were taught how to prepare teeth for crowns and not for veneers. So you're gonna, most of the time, run into dentists that are really trained on crown prep and maybe not on veneer prep. And so crowns, you're going to basically take the burr, reduce the tooth about a millimetre on top and cut all the way around, essentially, removing all of your enamel. Now, if the tooth is badly damaged, then maybe this is necessary, The only area that really necessitates or requires us to be bad aggressive and removing the animal all the way around the tooth would be if you had tooth decay on the back side of the tooth and I was going to show that to you there. I don't know if I can focus. So on this model here you can see I'm showing you the back side of teeth. Very rarely do you get any sort of decay right where my finger is",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general. So there you have it, those are my top five ways",

All right, so the 1990 means that your front knee is going to be at 90 degrees and your back is also. So let's go ahead and bring, you can do the near image of what I do. So I'm bringing my left foot forward, you bring your right foot forward. Just like this, so we see a 90 degrees here, we see a 90 degrees here and we're straight up. So we're going to start with a stretch. You're going to lean back here and you're going to feel stretch in that joint capsule. Okay, ooh that is a good stretch where we're going to do three different stretches and then we'll do the exercises that we're pulsing into that end-range motion. Just lean back feel that bring that leg back a little bit further if you can just so it comes straight off from",

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

Let's just do a few of these just warm it on a feeling good It's a happy day. Let's get those hips moving. Here we go work it, you're stretching your obliques right here, a little bit of the gluteus minimus. We have a maximus, we have a minimus. Let's give it a little attention here. All right, so the 1990 means that your front knee is going to be at 90 degrees and your back is also. So let's go ahead and bring, you can do the near image of what I do. So I'm bringing my left foot forward, you bring your right foot forward. Just like this, so we see a 90 degrees here, we see a 90 degrees here and we're straight up. So we're going to start with a stretch. You're going to lean back here and you're going to feel stretch in that joint capsule. Okay, ooh that is a good stretch where we're going to do three different stretches and then we'll do the exercises that we're pulsing into that end-range motion.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

We're going to have a lung bar pair of spine muscles and quadratus the forearm. My favorite way to do that is with the side. So I like to start with a modified side plank. You're going to be on your right elbow. My right elbow is underneath my right shoulder. My right knee is bent. My left leg is out straight. I'm then going to kick on these lateral hip muscles, lateral or four muscles to lift my hips up towards the ceiling. As I'm up in this modified, modified plank position, I'm on my right elbow and the outside of my right knee. I should have a straight line nose and belly button down between my knees. I will laugh for about 20 to 30 seconds and repeat that three times on each side. If that's too easy, what we can do is get into a full side plank. I just expanded my right leg out. Now I'm gonna get up into this position. I'm once again on my right elbow, but now I'm on the outside of my right foot.

Yeah, put pressure on the specific nerve. And that nerve will send symptoms, wherver that nerve tracks, and here they go down into the way. And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

In the case of the adult on this particular swab that works out perfectly almost every time for this junction to be the correct of insertion with the child or an infant you're going to go a little less deep so measuring is often very good especially in the younger kids so that you don't insert the swab too far. I'm now going to demonstrate inserting the swab correctly on myself and I'm going to show you how to do it where it causes a patient minimal discomfort and can easily be done in a type of setting. With the swab you're going to take it and very gently guide it into the air and you're going to feel it go just up and over at about this area you'll feel it just go over that little skin ledge at the bottom of the nose. At that point you want to take it and go horizontal and just continue to insert until you felt the correct depth and in this case I can feel I'm under the inferior terminates. You can see that this is not a noxious thing. It's not causing me any discomfort. I'm still sitting here fairly carefully talking to you",

Sometimes with this less flexible shaft, especially in lower kids that you're only inserting in a small distance. There is not as much control and you tend to have a little more flex in the swab shaft causing it not to pick up cells quite as well. So I typically prefer this shaft over the lower one bed both work equally well as far as picking up a sample. One of the things to know What you insert the swab is to go in a horizontal configuration to the patient's head. You can see on this diagram behind me and I'll use my swab as a pointer that you're actually going horizontally. You're not going vertically. You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area.

It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all. And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key.

As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would take that measurement and then divide it into two. So if you had four inches on the ruler, you would take an actually mark on your swab where two inches would be. So in this case, you would mark right about the junction of the thick portion of the swab narrowing down. In the case of the adult on this particular swab that works",

I'm here today to help produce a video To help train people have to do correct nasopharyngeal swabs. My expertise in point of care testing has had me to obtain several thousand of these. So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting",

With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit. And I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good release into my upper back right there. But this is a good way to really just pinpoint areas with the bed by sliding up and downwards like this and just focusing on the spots that need it the most. So here is a great upper back opener that you can do at the edge of a bed. You can also use the arm rest of a couch, a desk, or a chair. It just needs to be flat and elevated. We're also going to start off on",

I'm here today to help produce a video To help train people have to do correct nasopharyngeal swabs. My expertise in point of care testing has had me to obtain several thousand of these. So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab.

In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would take that measurement and then divide it into two.

And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can. And we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet. So even after you blow it out and you feel like you may be empty, I'll still coach it a key, blow and keep pushing, keep going, keep going, and then after a few seconds, I'll ask you to take another fast, you bet that again, and then I'll ask you to come off the mouthpiece. So let's go ahead and try it. Go ahead and put the nose clips on. I wanna be sure that you can't breathe through your nose.

And then we have our tubes, we have alcohol pads, the bandit, and we have the gloss pad to take care of the patient after we're done drawing blood. So the first thing you're going to do is put on a turning kit, So we have to look for a vein, and the turning kit is going to go, this is going to increase to the elbow, it's going to go about three to four inches above it, and once you put time to turn it, show our exhibition if it's too tight, and then that's the patient to pop their fist a couple times, and she's going to pop it, we'll pop it in is where she's going to just feel for a vein, and the vein will bounce back on her fingers that sure know that's a good thing. So you never go by site, you always go by touch to feel for a vein. And he has a pretty good vein right in the middle and this is the vein that we this is the first vein that we use in full army. And then just choice two and three. Once he has popated, she's going to clean the area and there is a proper way of cleaning the area which you're going to do is you're going to start from",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times.

And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times.

It\u2019s crucial to keep your chin tucked in to avoid inducing a neck hump, which can worsen the discomfort. Avoid letting your head drop forward during this process [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n2. **Stretching**: While maintaining the correct posture, gently lean your head toward the side where you feel the crick. This movement should be slow and controlled to prevent any additional strain on your neck.\n\n3. **Holding the Position**: You can use a prop, like a book, to help maintain the stretch. Hold the book in a way that allows you to feel the tension in your neck without overexerting yourself.\n\n4. **Releasing Tension**: After holding the stretch for a few seconds, gently drop the book to release the tension in your neck. This can help alleviate the crick.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always listen to your body; if the pain worsens, stop the exercise immediately and consult a healthcare professional.",

And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times.

So I'm working my middle and lower traps and I'm coming down slowly and I'm releasing. Okay, one more time. Squeezing shoulder blades together pulling away from the ears and lifting up. Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

          "text": "muscles. These are called your trapezius muscles. Now there's three parts to these muscles and you need to know about all of them to properly address this problem. There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll them forward so they're really good at creating neck pain. The middle traps actually squeeze the shoulder blades together. And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym",

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling.

Ensure your head is in a neutral position, looking straight ahead.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck**: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest. Imagine creating a double chin without tilting your head down. This movement should be subtle and controlled.\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain the chin tuck for 3 to 5 seconds. Focus on engaging the muscles at the back of your neck. Repeat this exercise 5 times, ensuring you do not strain your neck [Video 2: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 09:11-09:13].\n\n4. **Shoulder Position**: As you perform the chin tucks, pull your shoulders away from your ears and squeeze your shoulder blades together. This helps engage the middle and lower trapezius muscles, which support neck stability [Video 1: PdMJAhD7NEw, Time: 04:35-04:40].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Avoid overextending your neck or forcing the movement.",

In fact, head to toe, it's just one piece of skin. So if you want to have more relaxed facial expressions and less wrinkles on your forehead or you never lines, you need to take care of your scalp. I'll show you a very quick and easy scalp massage technique you can do any of it to lift up instantly and include the blood circulation to the face and to your scalp. Let's get started!

You can go cross-legged on the ground also. Let's start with some breathing through your nose, with some massage on either side of your nose. Do some circular motions here. You know, this nose needs to be open. Sometimes I'll have people do breathing exercise just holding open like that. Let's get them open, just by doing some massage, do some deep massage, get a little vigorous with it. Today, we are going to do 478 breathing. You're going to do four seconds in, seven second, hold, and eight second out. 478 breathing. It's a good one. It helps balance out the nervous system kind of defrazzly. Give you a clear palate. So your nervous system is ready to function the way it needs to function. Go out a little bit, let's get that face. anything connected to the nose, let's get it open, good. Okay, now let's open the lungs a little bit in the back, right? 360 is 360 degree all the way around. So we're gonna take the hands like this, push the palms together, curl forward, take a big breath in through the back body, feel it tighten up, breathing out, Pushing the hands even harder together good now we're going to come back we're in a class that the hands together like this take a big breath in.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Then our opinion, first week fast, today we're going to talk about what is a pensioner. A lot of people get a pensioner or they get a pain and they say they've been diagnosed. They say, well, somewhere you have a pensioner. We're going to talk about where you can pensioner and what it is and what symptoms it is. So first let's talk about the symptoms. What are the things you're going to feel when you have a pensioner? One thing you might have quite often is pain because you're getting compression on a nurse. What is happening? And the nurse are coming out from your spinal cord and going from the spinal cord into your arms and into your legs. And in this area they wrap around the trunk. Sure, they wrap around the trunk. So you can get actually pain or compression of a nerve anywhere in the body in an essence, right? So let's start talking about some of the common symptoms you're going to feel.

This position allows gravity to assist in the drops reaching the ear canal effectively [Video 1: v0HODFTrkqs, Time: 00:18-00:24].\n\n2. **Preparation**: Gently pull the outer ear (pinna) back and upward to straighten the ear canal, making it easier to see down into the ear.\n\n3. **Application**: Administer one drop of the medication into the ear canal. It is crucial to ensure that the dropper does not touch the ear to avoid contamination.\n\n4. **Facilitate Flow**: After applying the drop, gently press on the front of the ear. This action helps the drop travel down towards the eardrum, maximizing its effectiveness [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repeat**: If multiple drops are required, apply the next drop and continue this process until all prescribed drops have been administered.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always check the medication's instructions for specific usage guidelines and consult a healthcare provider if there are any concerns about ear health or if symptoms persist.",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So it actually stops that large inward curve in you like that. So lying down in this position. Coming down, now your forehead needs to be in contact with the ground, your arms are down and your palm are facing downwards. So I mean that position, now your head stays in contact with the ground during the whole exercise. The first exercise is to pull the shoulders away from the ears. Now can you try that at home or wherever you are? Head down, pull the shoulders away from your ears and then actually start to activate those lower trapezius muscles I was showing you on the diagram for earlier. Now second step is pull your shoulders away from your ears, squeeze your shoulders together and lift your hands just off the ground and now lower them down slowly and relax. Now you already know if you're doing this thing correctly. If you tend to be tight through upper traps, this is what you'll do. You'll lift and you'll pull up that way and",

So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the",

You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

      "answer": "To properly treat a foot sprain, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rest**: Limit movement and avoid putting weight on the injured foot as much as possible. This helps prevent further injury and promotes healing. Sit whenever you can to minimize strain on the foot.\n\n2. **Elevation**: Elevate your foot to the level of your chest. This can help reduce swelling by allowing fluids to drain away from the injured area. Use pillows or cushions to support your foot comfortably.\n\n3. **Ice**: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided evidence, applying ice to the sprain can help reduce swelling and pain. Typically, ice should be applied for 15-20 minutes every hour as needed.\n\n4. **Compression**: Use an elastic bandage or compression wrap to help control swelling. Ensure it\u2019s snug but not so tight that it restricts blood flow.\n\n5. **Seek medical attention**: If the pain is severe or if you are unable to walk, consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment options.\n\nFollowing these steps can promote healing and ensure a proper recovery from a foot sprain [Video 2: bUgV89cdfTM, Time: 00:43-00:48].",

Please check out my three exercises for acute lower back pain. The video will definitely help you get moving again and also prevent lower back pain. I still do those exercises on the daily. Now, if you do have flat feet, there could be a chance that you do have both legs, not knees, where your knees move inwards and you might want to do some exercises to prevent that or improve that, so you don't get the general change and promote flat feet. Please check out my both leg video. The video will definitely help you out.

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

We're going to come right down here on the ball force and then in this position so I've got my hands and under my shoulders, my knees are under my hips. I'm going to extend my right arm to straight in front of me as my left leg goes straight back and then we're going to return to the starting position and then repeat that over here on the other side. The primary problem that I encounter with this is people who want to roll their hips. They lose this stability in their back. So as I come here, you see how my hip opened up towards you. Welcome back to the works of the camera. Try not to let that happen. We're going to bring the hip down so that the hip stayed parallel to the floor throughout that whole exercise. Again, about 10 to 20 reps per side and then we're going to repeat that three times. One great way to improve stability in your lower back is to improve the lateral stability of your core.

So let's start we're gonna do a little 90 90 today Which is gonna you're gonna love this go ahead and just bring your hand over your hand over here and just stretch the side from this Cross leg a position. Let's just do a few of these just warm it on a feeling good It's a happy day. Let's get those hips moving. Here we go work it, you're stretching your obliques right here, a little bit of the gluteus minimus. We have a maximus, we have a minimus. Let's give it a little attention here. All right, so the 1990 means that your front knee is going to be at 90 degrees and your back is also. So let's go ahead and bring, you can do the near image of what I do. So I'm bringing my left foot forward, you bring your right foot forward. Just like this, so we see a 90 degrees here, we see a 90 degrees here and we're straight up. So we're going to start with a stretch. You're going to lean back here and you're going to feel stretch in that joint capsule. Okay, ooh that is a good stretch where we're going to do three different stretches and then we'll do the exercises that we're pulsing into that end-range motion. Just lean back feel that bring that leg back a little bit further if you can just so it comes straight off from",

And then return back to that starting position. And so that's what that full Superman looks like. We've got a lot more motion going at the lower back. So this does have potential to be a little more aggravating, but if you've worked up to this, and if you've done it the right away, this should be a very good exercise to minimize some of those excitement, your symptoms, and those that sat out in your table. About three sets of tanned is what I typically recommend for people on those Superman exercises. As far as you're free from seeing with these, I want you to just do these exercises once a day. You don't need necessarily do it more than that, but consistency is key. So make sure you come back right you really watch this video, give the cues that you need and perform the exercises the right way, so that you can see improvement.

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down. Come high as high as you",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

This is crucial as it sets the foundation for effective mobilization. Maintaining a straight back will enhance the effectiveness of the exercise [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 01:49-01:46].\n\n2. **Mobilization Technique**: The exercise involves mobilizing the area around the neck and upper back. This helps to alleviate tension and improve mobility, which is essential for reducing the neck hump.\n\n3. **Combination Movements**: Combine the mobilization with specific movements that target both the neck and upper back. This dual approach is highlighted as a powerful method to eliminate the hump effectively.\n\n4. **Consistency**: Regular practice of this exercise is recommended to achieve lasting results. Consistency is key in retraining your posture and reducing the hump.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always listen to your body and avoid any movements that cause pain. If you experience discomfort, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively work towards reducing your neck hump through the ATY mobil",

So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down. Come high as high as you",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

Sit back on your heels and extend your arms forward on the ground, forming a prayer position with your hands together.\n\n2. **Upper Body Positioning**: As you extend your arms, push your upper body through your arms. It's crucial to maintain a neutral head position; do not let your head drop forward as this can exacerbate the neck hump. Instead, tuck your chin in to keep your neck aligned [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n3. **Tension Awareness**: While holding this position, you should feel tension in the area of the neck hump. This indicates that the exercise is engaging the correct muscles.\n\n4. **Releasing Tension**: To enhance the effectiveness of the exercise, you can drop an object, like a book, to further engage your muscles and promote proper alignment. \n\n**Safety Note**: Always ensure your neck is aligned and avoid dropping your head forward to prevent further strain on the neck [Video 1].",

And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one out is this one's going to be a little bit differently so again you're going to use your arm but this time is going to go up so you can either just raise your arm or I like to kind of put it back this way where my elbows kind of pointing up towards this healing. So I'd be stretching this side now. So you're putting the arm up or the elbow up on the side that you want to stretch. And all this does, is this kind of pushes that shoulder blade down. And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades.

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

Squeeze your shoulder blades together and back. The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder",

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back.

This will help you maintain proper form during the stretch.\n\n3. **Body Movement**: Push your upper body through your arms while keeping your chin tucked in.

If they are coughing and encourage them to continue as they may be able to remove the obstruction, if they are unable to speak or cough, they need your help straight away. If coughing doesn't work, slap it out. Support the upper body with one hand and help them to bend forward. Use a heel of your hand to give up to five sharp back blows between their shoulder blades. Then check to see if there's anything in their mouth. If there is, tell them to pick it out. If back blows don't work, try giving up to five abdominal thrusts. Squeeze it out. To give With your domino thrust, stand behind them, put your arms around them and link your hands between their tummy button and the bottom of their chest. Clench your lower hand in a fist, grasp your fist with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards, repeat up to five times. Check them out. If they're still choking, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Use a speaker phone if you can. Keep repeating the five back blows and five abdominal thrust until the blockage clears or help arrives. If they become unresponsive, open the airway and check their breathing. If they're not breathing normally, start CPR. So remember, if someone's choking, cough it out, slap it out, squeeze it out. If it's not cleared, call 999 or 112 for emergency help. Keep",

So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the muscle a little bit of a break. So that 3 to 5 second hold, maybe doing 5 on each side, and that should really, again, not only help strengthen the muscle, it might help get you back into alignment a little bit and just get that neck pain out of there in general.

So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button down below and you can always find me at askdoctorjo.com. So we're going to start off with some stretches and then we'll move into the exercises towards the end. So the first stretch is an upper trap stretch. A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching",

Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up. Let me know if this worked for you comment below and subscribe to my channel for more. I'll see you next time.",

So there you have it, those are my top five ways to reduce neck pain.
