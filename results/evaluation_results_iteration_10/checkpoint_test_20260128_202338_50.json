That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back.

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck. So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms,",

So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter. Now I have devices for these to stimulate my scalp, which I love the a lot and it's especially this one, ooh, feels great, however I'm carried these with me all the time and my fingers are better because I can kind of control the pressure and I feel any spot if I have a little bit pain or tight area. So, use my fingers and any part never use the fingernails, okay? Relax your shoulders, breathe out, and then clasherly apply firm pressure. And then, who's your fingers up to the top of your head? And, come out, again, apply firm pressure. with your fingers and slide them. The top of your head, third one, apply front pressure and raise that relax your shoulders and slide",

Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back.

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as well. So that's nice and straight. Eyes level, eyes forward, chin up. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and back. The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

So the first structure that actually cause you a shoulder pin is your neck. shoulder pin can arise from your neck, especially if you're suffering from a ridiculously, which is essentially a nerve which is being pinched in the neck. And you know when you have a ridiculously, because you have this shooting pin from your, from your neck into your shoulder, into your elbow, into your arms, some of the even to your fingers. And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists",

That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past",

The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those. It's a top three exercises for neck pain and posture.",

Stand facing the corner with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place your forearms on the walls at shoulder height, creating a \"V\" shape with your body.\n\n2. **Stretching**: Lean your body forward into the corner. As you do this, gently turn your head away from the side where you feel pain. This motion helps to stretch the muscles on the opposite side of the neck, which may be tight or strained [Video 1: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\n3. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for 15-30 seconds, breathing deeply to enhance relaxation. Repeat this stretch a few times, ensuring you feel a gentle stretch without pain.\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: If you experience increased pain during the stretch, stop immediately. It\u2019s essential to listen to your body and avoid pushing into discomfort [Video 2: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:36-02:41].\n\n5. **Additional Care**: Consider applying ice",

Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

The process involves threading the end of the left strap through the left side of the plastic triangle buckle and securing it with the Velcro closure. Repeat this for the right strap [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 01:31-01:35]. \n\nThe brace is designed to stabilize the clavicle area, particularly after a fracture, by keeping the shoulders back and immobilizing the collarbone. It is important to note that the straps come in different widths depending on the size of the brace, with thicker straps providing better stabilization [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 01:05-01:09]. \n\nAfter securing both straps, the person assisting you should adjust the fit by pulling the straps tighter or loosening them to achieve the desired level of support for your clavicle and posture [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 01:35-01:35]. This ensures proper immobilization and aids in the healing process.",

And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa.

You can see on this diagram behind me and I'll use my swab as a pointer that you're actually going horizontally. You're not going vertically. You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area. If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all. And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key. So I'm going to go through a couple steps and show you exactly how this is done. I also want to tell you that this far is protected where and gear. Some people will deck out in everything including a gown, gloves, mask. I sheelts, typically in my setting the respiratory therapist, text, doctor's nurses. We all just put all the pair of gloves.

The supraclavicular lymph nodes are located above the clavicle in the supraclavicular fossa. Start by positioning your fingers in this area on both sides of the neck [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:22-01:36].\n\nGently palpate the supraclavicular fossa, applying pressure to feel for any abnormalities such as swelling or tenderness. It is important to use both hands to compare the nodes bilaterally, as this can help identify asymmetries or differences in size and consistency [Video 1]. \n\nWhile assessing, be mindful of the patient's comfort and communicate throughout the process to ensure they are not experiencing pain. If any abnormal masses are detected, note their size, consistency, and tenderness, as these features can provide valuable diagnostic information. Always maintain a professional demeanor and ensure the patient feels safe during the examination. \n\nThis methodical approach will help in effectively assessing the supraclavicular lymph nodes.",

The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles.

This is crucial as the examination involves close contact with the patient, often from behind them [Video 2].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Have the patient in a comfortable position, preferably seated. You may need to stand or sit behind them to access the area effectively.\n\n3. **Locating the Nodes**: The submental lymph nodes are located beneath the chin. Use both hands to apply direct pressure in this area [Video 3: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:48-01:56].\n\n4. **Examination Technique**: With your fingers positioned under the chin, palpate gently but firmly to feel for any abnormalities, such as masses or enlarged nodes. Assess the nodes for size, consistency, and tenderness, noting any unusual findings.\n\n5. **Documentation**: After the examination, document your findings and communicate any concerns to the patient.\n\nAlways ensure the patient is comfortable throughout the examination and explain what you are doing to maintain transparency and trust [Video 1].",

You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

Explain the procedure to the patient to ensure they are aware of what to expect.\n\n3. **Locate the Nodes**: The cervical lymph nodes are arranged in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck, located deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscles and superficial to the scalene muscles [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 02:04-02:13].\n\n4. **Examination Technique**: Use your fingers to palpate the lymph nodes bilaterally.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is a much more intense technique. It really digs into the muscle so it can release it. This is a type of Myrofascial release. Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area.

It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all.

This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Obtain consent for the examination, as it is crucial to maintain trust and comfort during the procedure, especially since much of the examination occurs from behind the patient [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Position the patient comfortably, ideally seated, so you can access the lymph nodes effectively.\n\n3. **Locating the Lymph Nodes**: The preauricular lymph nodes are located just in front of the ear, while the postauricular lymph nodes are situated behind the ear. Use your fingers to palpate these areas gently.\n\n4. **Examination Technique**: Employ a bilateral approach, using your fingers to feel for any swelling or tenderness in both the preauricular and postauricular regions. It is essential to apply a gentle but firm pressure to assess the nodes accurately [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:22-01:36].\n\n5. **Documentation**: Note any abnormalities such as size",

      "answer": "To examine the occipital lymph nodes, begin by ensuring that the patient is aware of the procedure and where you will be placing your hands. This helps to establish comfort and cooperation during the examination. \n\n1. Position the patient comfortably, preferably sitting or lying down, to allow easy access to the back of the head.\n2. Locate the occipital region, which is situated at the base of the skull. The occipital lymph nodes are typically found just above the nape of the neck.\n3. Using your fingers, gently palpate the area at the back of the head, applying light pressure to feel for any lymph nodes. It is important to use both hands to assess bilaterally, ensuring a thorough examination.\n4. While palpating, assess for size, tenderness, mobility, and consistency of any nodes you may find, noting any abnormalities. \n\nAlways communicate with the patient throughout the examination to ensure their comfort and to explain what you are doing. This approach is consistent with the general principles of lymph node examination as discussed in the video [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:22-01:36].",

If you don't snore someone in your house in either way, it can affect the whole house. Right. Like I was telling you earlier, my daughter was before she left the house, she didn't just leave. Anyways, she went to the college. We kept her awake many nights from our snoring. Not just me, but my wife as well. And so it's a problem. So, why do you snore? It happens because when you fall asleep, the muscles in your throat, they relax, and with open mouth breathing, it starts to get these vibrations, and you know, it can be like, my dad was just as a chainsaw, you know? All right. How many cords would you cut last night, dad? Yeah, I had a friend that stayed in our cabin. It was, it was unreal. It was a phenomena. I mean, did you hand out your plugs? Oh, I mean, I had door shut, and you could hear him. I mean, Yeah, I mean, I think the towel is complaining. Yeah, we don't want to talk about it, right? So I would make the news. What seriously, you can get this look that by a doctor. I think you should. You can talk to them. One thing they might do, this is, we're not doing this video to promote this necessarily because you probably don't need it. But sometimes a sleep study, you",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

Now can you try that at home or wherever you are? Head down, pull the shoulders away from your ears and then actually start to activate those lower trapezius muscles I was showing you on the diagram for earlier. Now second step is pull your shoulders away from your ears, squeeze your shoulders together and lift your hands just off the ground and now lower them down slowly and relax.

So I mean that position, now your head stays in contact with the ground during the whole exercise. The first exercise is to pull the shoulders away from the ears. Now can you try that at home or wherever you are? Head down, pull the shoulders away from your ears and then actually start to activate those lower trapezius muscles I was showing you on the diagram for earlier. Now second step is pull your shoulders away from your ears, squeeze your shoulders together and lift your hands just off the ground and now lower them down slowly and relax. Now you already know if you're doing this thing correctly. If you tend to be tight through upper traps, this is what you'll do. You'll lift and you'll pull up that way and that's those muscles at the top there working against the lower one. So we want to pull the shoulders away from the ears just a little bit. So you're lengthening, you're lifting and you squeezing and coming down slowly and relaxing. So that's the first thing you can do.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Lie down on your back on a flat surface. Ensure your head is supported comfortably.\n\n2. **Engage the Muscles**: Focus on your upper traps, which may be overly tight. You will need to strengthen the lower traps to counteract this tension. This can be done by gently pulling your shoulder blades down and back, engaging the lower traps [Video 1: PdMJAhD7NEw, Time: 02:14-02:18].\n\n3. **Squeeze and Release**: While lying down, perform a squeezing motion with your shoulder blades together. Inhale deeply as you squeeze, then exhale and let your shoulders relax. This helps in releasing tension and promoting better alignment [Video 3: B9yiDTONlOs, Time: 01:56-02:00].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat this exercise for several repetitions, focusing on the sensation of release in your neck and shoulders.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience any sharp pain during these exercises, stop immediately",

We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs. Where are from the back to the legs are you getting a pinch of hair and which we use you call sciatica sure The other thing we thought we talked about a couple fun ones right, Brad With this some names out there for nerves that could pinched and these are the ones that are",

It's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here kind of trying to kind of investigate of the job trying to figure out where the problem is coming from. So let's talk about a couple of some of the common areas where you might have a pinched nerve. Nancy could be at the spine right away. Who's catching? Okay. Okay. We've got our spine here. This is really where the partial head here. These are the bones that stack up to make your back, you know, within the bones itself there's a canal and that's your spinal cord and coming off the spinal cord are these nerves All right, these are the nerves that can get compressed or pinched, all right? One of the common areas that can get pinched is right when it's coming out of these holes here, right, right in that spot here. As you get older, you want to zoom in and, Brad, can you kind of point out? Okay, so the nerves are never, or not, a half inch lot of like I've heard they actually, the nerves are here. Hold on.

And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back.

And this is apparently what happens if you fall asleep like on a bar or over the over a chair Like that on the back of your arm there that's a radial nerve palsy and you'll wake up and you're so drunk and you don't wake up at all. You wake up",

And then the pain that you get also often from nerve pain is quite often, some of the worst pain you can do. Yeah, nerve pain is not fun at all. Exactly. You know, when you can tell when someone's drilling into a nerve, that's the way they'll make you talk. And they want to talk here. So the other thing that could be causing pressure on a nerve is even scar tissue. Usually when you're in a nerve, the nerve can actually get scar down. And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if",

Because that tells us possibly which nerve is actually being pinched. We know it's all mapped out where L3, the nerve coming out of L3, your number is spying where it goes down in your leg. We know how L5 was down at the top of your foot if you feel symptoms there, right? So where you're having the pain, it could be where you're having the pinched nerve but quite often it isn't. It's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here kind of trying to kind of investigate of the job trying to figure out where the problem is coming from.

Because that tells us possibly which nerve is actually being pinched. We know it's all mapped out where L3, the nerve coming out of L3, your number is spying where it goes down in your leg.

      "answer": "To identify if you may have a pinched nerve, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess Pain Location**: Pay attention to where you feel pain. This is crucial as it can indicate which nerve may be compressed. For instance, pain in specific areas of the arm or leg can help pinpoint the affected nerve, as therapists and physicians will assess these locations during evaluation [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 02:33-02:38].\n\n2. **Identify Symptoms**: Note any additional symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in the affected area. These symptoms often accompany nerve compression.\n\n3. **Consider Movement Impact**: Observe if certain movements increase your pain. If moving in specific ways exacerbates discomfort, this could suggest nerve involvement [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 06:06-06:09].\n\n4. **Consult a Professional**: If you suspect a pinched nerve, consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. They may perform tests to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best treatment approach.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: Avoid self-diagnosing or treating without professional guidance, as improper",

If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed.

Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

You may wake up with an inability to move your arm or wrist, particularly if you feel numbness or weakness in these areas [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\n2. **Assess Arm Position**: Consider how you were positioned while sleeping. If your arm was resting against a hard surface or in a way that could compress the radial nerve, this increases the likelihood of palsy.\n\n3. **Check Wrist Movement**: Test your wrist movement. If you find it difficult to bend your wrist or if you experience a lack of control, these could be indicators of nerve compression [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 06:58-07:00].\n\n4. **Seek Medical Attention**: If you suspect you have Saturday night palsy, consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. They can determine if the",

You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can.

The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those.

You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here.

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

You may wake up feeling numb or weak in your arm [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\n2. **Assess Positioning**: Consider how you were positioned while sleeping. If you were in a position that could lead to nerve compression, such as leaning on your arm, this increases the likelihood of developing palsy [Video 1].\n\n3. **Evaluate Pain or Discomfort**: Pay attention to any discomfort or pain in your arm or wrist.

But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those.

You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here.

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

For instance, if you fall asleep with your arm in an awkward position (like over a bar or chair), you might wake up unable to move your arm due to radial nerve palsy, which is a form of neuropathy [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\n2. **Pain or Tingling**: Pay attention to any sensations of tingling or pain that radiate from your arm or hand. These symptoms may suggest that a nerve is being pinched, leading to conditions like sciatica or other neuropathies [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:14-07:19].\n\n3. **Duration of Symptoms**: If these symptoms persist after changing positions or if you notice significant weakness in your arm, it is advisable to seek medical attention.

Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

You could have degeneration of the bones and to the point where they make the whole smaller where the nerves come out, or you could have thoracic outlets in them. That's where you get impenething between the collar bone and the first rib, right? So, and you could also just have compression of muscles. And in the neck, so there's more, but there's more. Yeah, I don't need the bore, that's right. So neck pain can vary in location intensity. It depends on your diagnosis, your age, and your posture. But the common locations are, and I guess we got kind of, we met them out. We met them out. This is for a pinch nerve, but it's very common to have neck pain, of course, up in the neck itself. But then you can also, Brad, do you want to show off some other stuff? Sure. So a lot of people may not be aware of this, but oftentimes there's something called referral pain, the repane refers down to the shoulder blade area. That's very common. I can come over this way under the shoulder as the blue tape shows. And then if it's a nerve and it's pinched pretty bad, it's very common that it's going to go down the arm. Now",

This can occur if there is significant pressure on the radial nerve, which can happen when using crutches improperly or resting your arm in a certain position for too long, such as falling asleep on it [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\n2. **Numbness or Weakness**: You may experience a feeling of numbness or weakness in your arm. This condition may arise when the nerve is compressed to the extent that it cannot stimulate the muscles effectively [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 08:00-08:05].\n\n3. **Positioning Awareness**: Be mindful of how you position your arm. If you find yourself resting your arm in a way that could pinch the nerve, such as leaning on it or placing excessive weight on it, this could lead to symptoms of crutch palsy [Video 1].\n\n4. **Seek Medical Attention**: If you notice these symptoms",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from. Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground. Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

      "answer": "To prevent your foot from falling asleep while driving, you can perform specific exercises that enhance circulation and flexibility in your feet and calves. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Ankle Rolls**: While seated, roll your ankles outwards and then inwards. This helps to mobilize the joints and improve blood flow to your feet.\n\n2. **Heel Lifts**: Push the balls of your feet into the ground while lifting your heels up. This action engages your calf muscles, which is crucial for maintaining circulation.\n\n3. **Squeeze Calf Muscles**: Visualize squeezing your calf muscles as if performing a calf raise. This contraction promotes blood flow and can help alleviate the sensation of numbness.\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim to perform this sequence for 15 to 20 repetitions, completing 3 to 4 sets. Regular practice can enhance the strength and flexibility of your feet, reducing the likelihood of them falling asleep while driving [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 02:02-02:08].\n\n5. **Safety Note**: Ensure that these exercises do not distract you from driving. It\u2019s best to perform them when stopped or in a safe",

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were?

We have the most famous physical therapists on the internet. And our opinion, of course, got to warm up Brad. Brad, we're going to talk about hand and finger exercises, range and motion and strengthening that you can do. We're going to show you a progression. Show you some exercises you can do at home, and then we're going to show you a set set here that was actually provided us to us by F.E.I. again. F.E.I. Fabrication and Apprises Incorporated. This is the catalog. If you are a therapist, I would highly suggest that you grab one and get one. Sure. You go to their website. We'll put that link below, all right. And but they gave us all this stuff. We're not getting paid for this. But we don't get paid for anything to do with that. No, but we only like to represent quality, our products that we like, the good quality products. And we feel good about giving a little bump to them. Plug to them, yeah. OK. By the way, they provide some of these proxure retailers too. And stuff. Sure. Yeah, these will probably be used mostly for therapists. I don't think people are going to buy these for an individual at home if they had an accident or rehabbing, but then at least you'll know what they're looking, which you're looking at when you go to",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

By the way, they provide some of these proxure retailers too. And stuff. Sure. Yeah, these will probably be used mostly for therapists.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

      "answer": "To strengthen your fingers after an injury, stroke, or cast removal, you can perform specific exercises focusing on bending the fingers at the knuckles. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Start with Finger Claw Exercise**: Begin by positioning your fingers straight. Gradually bend them at the knuckles to form a claw shape. This exercise helps in regaining mobility and strength. Aim to perform this motion 10 times for each hand [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:32-04:34].\n\n2. **Focus on the PIP Joint**: Next, concentrate on bending at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. This joint is crucial for finger movement and may feel stiff post-injury. Gently bend each finger at the PIP joint, ensuring you do not force the movement if it causes pain. If bending is difficult, proceed slowly and only to the point of comfort [Video 1].\n\n3. **Repetition and Consistency**: Perform these exercises regularly, aiming for multiple sets throughout the day to enhance flexibility and strength.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience significant pain or discomfort while performing these exercises, consult a healthcare professional",

And sometimes what they have you do is slide to the bottom of this finger and then go back. Start again. If you've got a itch on your finger, you could itch it with your hand like that. Oh, again, surprisingly, Brad, if you do it, when you don't use the hand a lot in that certain fashion, the hand actually gets tired. Yeah, I can feel those muscles working on.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

      "answer": "To strengthen your fingers after an injury, stroke, or cast removal, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Warm-Up**: Start with gentle movements to warm up your fingers. This can include flexing and extending them slowly.\n\n2. **Bending the Fingers**: Focus on bending each finger at the PIP joint (the middle joint). This is crucial for regaining mobility. You may find it challenging initially, but consistency is key. Aim to perform this bending exercise 10 times for each finger. This will help in rebuilding strength and flexibility [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:32-04:34].\n\n3. **Claw Position**: Practice moving your fingers into a claw position and then straightening them. This exercise can help improve coordination and strength. \n\n4. **Repetition**: Regularly repeat these exercises throughout the day to enhance recovery. \n\n5. **Listen to Your Body**: If you experience pain, reduce the intensity or frequency of the exercises. It's important to progress at your own pace, especially after an injury.\n\nAlways consult with a healthcare professional before starting any rehabilitation exercises to ensure they are appropriate for your specific condition.",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

One, you can of course just do full flexion. And you can work on just flexing the end of the finger tips like this, so you get that pincer grip versus the full. And that's one other one you can do Brad is you can just do pincer like this or put the two fingers together. You can work a pincer on each finger. You can actually work on just extension, of course. And then you can even hook in here and work on flexion like this, individually. So if you want to just work on flexor like this, if you want to break it down on that entailed. So there's a lot of different things you can do with that. So really cool set. Again, you can look at the website below. You know, right now I'm afraid we got to stop and let our occupational therapists have their hand out of it. And remember Brad and I can fix this about anything, except for that broken hurt. I don't know if this is going to help with that. We can make, you know, there you go. Okay, thanks.",

Like the technique before, it just plays to your thumb where the trigger point is. But now slowly, external and internally rotate your arm. This is the action of the sub scapula muscle. By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle. Therefore, working on the muscle spindles of the subscaptor muscle, do about 8 to 10",

      "answer": "To strengthen your fingers after an injury, stroke, or cast removal, you can perform a simple exercise that involves touching each finger to your thumb. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Start Position**: Hold your hand in front of you with your fingers extended and your thumb pointing up.\n2. **Touch the Thumb**: Begin by touching the tip of your thumb to the tip of your index finger. Hold for a moment.\n3. **Progress to Each Finger**: Next, touch your thumb to your middle finger, then to your ring finger, and finally to your pinky finger. Make sure to return to the starting position after each touch.\n4. **Repeat**: Perform this exercise 10 times for each finger. This repetition helps improve dexterity and strength in your fingers [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:32-04:34].\n\n**Safety Notes**: If you experience pain or discomfort while performing this exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. It\u2019s important to proceed slowly and gently, especially after an injury, as these movements may be challenging initially [Video 1].",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe,",

      "answer": "To practice speech therapy with an iPad after suffering a stroke, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Evaluate Skills**: Begin by assessing various skill areas that speech therapy addresses, including speech, language skills, cognitive linguistic skills, and swallowing disorders. This comprehensive evaluation is crucial as it helps identify specific needs [Video 1: LqMs2kA5Y88, Time: 01:35-01:40].\n\n2. **Use Therapy Apps**: Download speech therapy applications designed for stroke recovery. These apps often include exercises for improving speech, language, and cognitive skills. Look for features that focus on short-term memory and attention, as these are vital areas post-stroke [Video 1: LqMs2kA5Y88, Time: 02:07-02:12].\n\n3. **Engage in Regular Practice**: Set a routine for daily practice. Consistency is key in rehabilitation. Utilize the iPad to engage in exercises that challenge deductive reasoning and multitasking abilities, which are important for cognitive recovery [Video 1: LqMs2kA5Y88, Time: 02:07-02:12].\n\n4. **Monitor Progress**: Keep track of improvements and",

Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off.

          "text": "First degree burns are very common. Unlike second or third degree burns, first degree burns only involve the top layer of the skin. People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

          "text": "In this video, I'm going to show you how to self-release your upper back for instant pain relief stay tuned. Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover. Static Sub-Scaped Massage The Sub-Scaped Laris pain referral penance is meant in the rear shoulder and sometimes in the back of your wrist and have your arm up and reach in with your other thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

But once we hit a very deep but comfortable stretch, what I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a little bit like this. This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release. I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief.

I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot.

      "answer": "To perform an upper back opener exercise for self-release and instant pain relief, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by sitting or standing comfortably. Ensure your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed. This position helps in effectively targeting the upper back muscles.\n\n2. **Movement**: Gently arch your upper back by pushing your chest forward while simultaneously drawing your shoulder blades together. This motion helps to create space in the thoracic spine, relieving tension in the upper back.\n\n3. **Breathing**: As you perform the arching motion, take deep breaths. Inhale deeply to expand your chest and exhale slowly while relaxing into the stretch. This breathing technique enhances relaxation and aids in muscle release.\n\n4. **Duration**: Hold this position for a few seconds, repeating the movement several times. This repetition helps to gradually release tightness in the upper back.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: If you experience any sharp pain during the exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. It's essential to listen to your body and avoid pushing through pain [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41]. \n\nThis exercise can be a beneficial way",

If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this.

What I'm going to do is start with one leg straight. Usually the leg that's closest towards the edge of the bed. And then the other side, what I'm going to do is bend the knee and then keep the foot flat. I'm just going to press into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press down for stable anchor point. Let's take the hand that's closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge. Just for a little bit more support. What I'm going to do from there is bend the other sides arm, so in this case, I'm going to take my right elbow and I'm going to place it on the inside of my right knee. From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards the left. From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't",

This will create a passive stretch into the upper back, and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click, or crack. Again, that is just gas is being released from the joints. You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level.",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

This one is best done at the edge of a bed, but you can also do this one on the floor. What I'm going to do is start with one leg straight. Usually the leg that's closest towards the edge of the bed. And then the other side, what I'm going to do is bend the knee and then keep the foot flat. I'm just going to press into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press down for stable anchor point. Let's take the hand that's closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge. Just for a little bit more support. What I'm going to do from there is bend the other sides arm, so in this case, I'm going to take my right elbow and I'm going to place it on the inside of my right knee.

This will create a passive stretch into the upper back, and if it is locked up, you may feel it go pop, click, or crack. Again, that is just gas is being released from the joints. You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it",

I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there. And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release. So here is what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch, and it's a very good upper back opener because we can do a little bit of rotation in there to get those joints moving. This one is best done at the edge of a bed, but you can also do this one on the floor. What I'm going to do is start with one leg straight. Usually the leg that's closest towards the edge of the bed. And then the other side, what I'm going to do is bend the knee and then keep the foot flat. I'm just going to press into the side of my calf right here with that foot and press down for stable anchor point. Let's take the hand that's closest towards the edge of the bed, grab onto the edge.

So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder the other side shoulder When you do this you'll really feel it open up into the neck right here and a lot of times You'll get a sudden pop crack or release into the neck or into the upper back It usually feels really good again with this one don't try to force it You want to hold this one for about 15 to",

The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder the other side shoulder When you do this you'll really feel it open up into the neck right here and a lot of times You'll get a sudden pop crack or release into the neck or into the upper back It usually feels really good again with this one don't try to force it You want to hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds you're just going to relax and then on the next repetition drive the arm over a little bit more and then take the ear down towards the shoulder even more get a better stretch each time and I would do this on both sides to keep them in balance.

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So for demonstrated purposes, I will be using my can of soup. So if you are using the soup can, just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like this and then roll it up and you kind of have a homemade foam roller.

So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open.

There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg.

There's the upper trapezius and these muscles go from the back of the shoulder blade and make a touch up here into the back of the neck. These upper traps here lift your shoulders and roll them forward so they're really good at creating neck pain. The middle traps actually squeeze the shoulder blades together. And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment. I'm going to lie down on my tummy to show you the position to start working those middle and lower traps and these are really basic beginner's exercises to getting these muscles started. Lie down on your tummy and I'm going to use the pillow underneath my pelvis you might like to do that at home or in the gym",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up.

Place your hands on the wall at shoulder height, with your elbows slightly bent.\n\n2. **Angle Your Body**: Lean your body slightly towards one side, for instance, the right side. This positioning helps target the upper trapezius more effectively [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 04:34-04:36].\n\n3. **Experiment with Angles**: Move your body to different angles, leaning towards the right and then the left. This variation allows you to find the most effective stretch for your muscles [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 04:34-04:36].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Perform the stretch up to five times, gradually leaning further into the stretch with each repetition. This helps challenge the muscles and may lead to a self-release or pop in the joints [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 04:23-04:25].\n\n**Safety Note",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

What you're going to notice is it opens the back up just a little bit differently. So experiment with different angles. Go all the way towards the right and then go all the way towards the left. If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there. And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release. So here is what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch, and it's a very good upper back opener",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

Place your arms at a Y position, with your elbows bent and hands resting on the wall at shoulder height. This position helps to open up the chest and stretch the upper back muscles.\n\n2. **Stretching**: Lean your body weight gently into the corner, allowing your chest to move forward while keeping your head and neck aligned. This action will create a stretch across your upper back and shoulders. \n\n3. **Breathing**: As you lean into the stretch, take deep breaths. Inhale deeply and exhale slowly, which can enhance the relaxation of the muscles in your upper back.\n\n4. **Duration**: Hold this position for about five seconds and repeat the stretch ten times. If you feel comfortable, you can extend this to twenty repetitions for a more effective release [Video 2: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 02:31-02:34].\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you do not overextend or push into pain while performing this stretch.

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching the top of my ear. Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards",

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot.

Ensure your posture is upright to facilitate the stretch.\n\n2. **Arm Position**: Extend one arm out to the side at shoulder height. This helps stabilize your shoulder blade during the stretch [Video 2: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 03:21-03:25].\n\n3. **Twisting Motion**: Slowly twist your upper body towards the extended arm. As you do this, engage your core to maintain stability and avoid straining your lower back.\n\n4. **Head Position**: Keep your head aligned with your spine. Do not drop your head down or lean it to the side; instead, focus on rotating your torso to enhance the stretch in your upper back [Video 2: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 03:21-03:25].\n\n5. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for several breaths, allowing your upper back to release tension. \n\n**Safety Note**: If you feel any sharp pain or discomfort, stop immediately and consult",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

But once we hit a very deep but comfortable stretch, what I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a little bit like this. This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release. I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief. If the exercise is held, please support the channel by giving this video like and maybe subscribing to the channel too. If you have any comments or questions, please leave them below. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for",

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

Ensure your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed.\n\n2. **Movement**: Gently extend your upper back by arching it backward. You can do this by placing your hands behind your head and leaning back slightly. This movement helps to mobilize the tight areas in your upper back [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41].\n\n3. **Neck and Head Position**: If you experience pain, it\u2019s beneficial to stretch and move your head and neck in the opposite direction of the discomfort. For instance, if the pain is on one side, turn your head away from that side to lengthen the muscles that are already tight [Video 2: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\n4. **Breathing**: While performing these movements, remember to breathe deeply and steadily. This can help in relaxing the muscles further.\n\n**Safety Note**: If you feel any sharp pain or discomfort during these",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover. Static Sub-Scaped Massage The Sub-Scaped Laris pain referral penance is meant in the rear shoulder and sometimes in the back of your wrist and have your arm up and reach in with your other thumb into the back of your shoulder blade. The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out.

It's really tight, achy and painful and it needs a little bit more attention. Let's stop right over that spot. From there what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much as we can, really put the back into a backwards extension just like this, and then from there I'm going to plant my feet on the floor and then lift my butt up, kind of like creating a bridge like exercise. This time what's going to happen is that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the can into the floor, and it really intensifies the stretch. It feels really, really good for me. And if that joint is locked up, this might get it too self-release. but you can hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds. If it feels good, hold it for longer. You can hold it upwards towards the minute, but we need to breathe out just lower your butt down like this. And then repeat it about three to five times. From there, you can just switch over different spots as needed. If it still feels like it does not watch release, what we can do from there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement.

We don't want to do this one on the lower back because that can cause irritation, but just roll up and down, just allowing gravity to take your shoulders, elbows and head down just like this. And with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop crack or cell for leaves. But you can do this one nice and slowly up and down for about 5 to 10 complete repetitions. If you do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do this certain step, but you should be able to do the others. So let's say that you have one spot that just will not release. It's really tight, achy and painful and it needs a little bit more attention. Let's stop right over that spot. From there what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much as we can, really put the back into a backwards extension just like this, and then from there I'm going to plant my feet on the floor and then lift my butt up, kind of like creating a bridge like exercise.

I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

      "answer": "To perform dynamic movements in an extension exercise for self-releasing your upper back, you can incorporate specific techniques that involve stretching and mobilization. Start by gently moving your head and neck in the opposite direction of any pain you are experiencing. For instance, if you feel discomfort on one side, turn your head away from that side and stretch towards the opposite side. This helps elongate the muscles that may be tight or painful, providing relief [Video 2: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Rowe emphasizes the importance of self-release techniques for tight or locked spots in the upper or middle back. Although the video does not detail specific dynamic movements, it suggests that mobilization can be beneficial for pain relief [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41]. \n\nIn summary, to achieve instant pain relief in your upper back, focus on dynamic stretches that involve moving your head and neck away from the pain, while also considering self-release techniques for targeted areas of discomfort.",

Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations. So that's really how you kind of lock these feelings in and make it feel better for the long haul. So if you guys like this, give me a thumbs up in this video and share it with a friend who's experiencing some foot ankle, some planar fishitis, maybe some, um, tibial tendonitis into the foot area and they run and they're they're just frustrated, okay. You guys are looking for more information on how to resolve putting any conditions. I created a little mini guide for you on the corner here, pretty straight into the point.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

      "answer": "To reduce ankle pain using skin rolling techniques, you can employ a method that involves both your fingers and a suction cup. This approach targets the area behind the medial malleolus and into the arch or heel, which is commonly associated with pain from running. Skin rolling helps to alleviate local irritation caused by nerves in that region, which may mimic plantar fascia pain [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 00:34-00:52].\n\nTo perform skin rolling, gently grasp the skin over the painful area and roll it back and forth. This technique can improve circulation and reduce tension in the surrounding tissues, potentially leading to decreased pain and improved mobility. It's important to combine this technique with other supportive measures like ice, heat, or anti-inflammatory medications, as these can further aid in managing your symptoms [Video 3: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:36-02:41].\n\nIn summary, utilizing skin rolling along with complementary treatments can effectively help alleviate ankle pain associated with running.",

Don't worry too much about the red dots, it's just blood kind of coming to the surface because it is a suction cup, but we're not trying to pull blood or anything like that or do any acupuncture, okay. So these are just simple things you can do with a suction cup. You can get them for like five bucks on Amazon, you get like a whole set. And you'd be surprised you do this pretty frequently throughout the day, like five times or so. And all of a sudden the stuff starts to dissipate and you wonder, why the heck did the suction cup or skin pulling work with this thing, right? It's just a way to desense ties the area. So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations. So that's really how you kind of lock these feelings in and make it feel better for the long haul. So if you guys like this, give me a thumbs up in this video and share it with a friend who's",

That's why I have the suction cup. So with the suction cups you can go in and around first the area right here where we can do the tarsal tunnel and do some simple movements or even if you like, if you have problems with running, if you have problems with impact, put it on there and jog around. be surprised that it might just reduce and keep the camera where it's at right there. So as I stand right here and as I go through some lunging, okay, or as I go through some hop-in, this is all good and fine to do as well, move it down a little bit. Don't worry too much about the red dots, it's just blood kind of coming to the surface because it is a suction cup, but we're not trying to pull blood or anything like that or do any acupuncture, okay.

Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than",

That's why I have the suction cup. So with the suction cups you can go in and around first the area right here where we can do the tarsal tunnel and do some simple movements or even if you like, if you have problems with running, if you have problems with impact, put it on there and jog around. be surprised that it might just reduce and keep the camera where it's at right there. So as I stand right here and as I go through some lunging, okay, or as I go through some hop-in, this is all good and fine to do as well,",

Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible.

Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than the other so you can grab the skin and start to move again but I just can see it's hard to grab. That's why I have the suction cup.

      "answer": "To reduce ankle pain using a suction cup, you can apply the suction cup to the affected area and perform gentle movements of the ankle and toes. This technique helps mobilize the soft tissue and may alleviate discomfort. As you apply the suction cup, you can manipulate the skin and surrounding tissues to enhance circulation and relieve tension. It's important to note that the suction cup may cause temporary red dots on the skin, which are a result of increased blood flow to the surface, but this is normal and not a cause for concern [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 02:06-02:09].\n\nAdditionally, engaging in light activities such as jogging or lunging while the suction cup is applied can further aid in reducing pain and improving mobility. The suction cup technique can be particularly beneficial for individuals experiencing discomfort during impact activities like running [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 01:58-02:00].\n\nIn summary, using a suction cup on the ankle while performing gentle movements and light exercises can help reduce pain and improve function.",

So hopefully that makes sense but that's one reason, that's this really the second reason why I would avoid crowns is that it changes the bite surface of your natural teeth to a prosthetic and it's really in an area that that's not super beneficial for you.

And they will also be able to do veneers. and veneers are just maybe similar to a three-quarter pound, maybe even a little more conservative than that in their prep. These are great ways to avoid long-term challenges or problems with your teeth. So I would encourage you to go to a dentist who has the ability to create same-day restorations. That'll be a big benefit to you. And go to a dentist who understands how to prepare teeth for veneers and doesn't require or recommend crowns when the backside of the tooth is healthy. The topic of this video came up from just this last week. I had a patient come in and had some concerns with their smile and wanted to improve it. And they came to me and they were fairly young and they were recommended to have. I believe it was like 20 crowns performed and prepped on their teeth. And they were very young. Obviously it's a big concern to me. I advise the patient definitely don't do that. Go to a dentist that is going to be able to prepare the teeth much more minimally so you have the best chance of having long term health there and here at Innovative Dental, we pride ourselves in that. So hopefully this video is helpful. My goal here is to just try to educate and bring some insight",

You know, cool, I've got, you made me understand why I don't need a crown, but what am I supposed to do? I believe that most dentists that are really providing the most conservative care are going to be comfortable doing three-quarter crowns or partial crowns that don't cut down the backside of the tooth. And they will also be able to do veneers. and veneers are just maybe similar to a three-quarter pound, maybe even a little more conservative than that in their prep. These are great ways to avoid long-term challenges or problems with your teeth. So I would encourage you to go to a dentist who has the ability to create same-day restorations. That'll be a big benefit to you. And go to a dentist who understands how to prepare teeth for veneers and doesn't require or recommend crowns when the backside of the tooth is healthy. The topic of this video came up from just this last week. I had a patient come in and had some concerns with their smile and wanted to improve it. And they came to me and they were fairly young and they were recommended to have. I believe it was like 20 crowns performed and prepped on their teeth. And they were very young. Obviously it's a big concern to me. I advise",

      "answer": "Crowning of the teeth alters the biting surface by modifying the natural contours and functional areas of the teeth. When a traditional crown is placed, particularly on the backside of the front teeth, it can change the surface where chewing occurs. This is significant because the biting surface is crucial for effective mastication. As noted, when the crown is applied, it alters the area where the teeth come into contact during chewing, which can impact how food is processed in the mouth [Video 2: LL854--GBy4, Time: 05:34-05:36].\n\nAdditionally, preserving the natural tooth structure is vital. The back side of the front teeth is where the majority of chewing takes place, and any alteration here can lead to changes in bite dynamics and potentially affect the alignment of the jaw [Video 1: LL854--GBy4, Time: 05:05-05:10]. \n\nIn summary, the crowning process can significantly change the biting surface, impacting chewing efficiency and overall dental function. It is essential to consider these factors when planning restorative dental procedures.",

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first.

By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past",

So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps",

And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional where you can go about and do your things but you're still either getting that heat if you need it or if you need that cold afterwards you can do that as well. And so it's really nice also because it's not plugged in so you can move around with it on you sometimes with traditional heating pads, you actually have to plug it",

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first.

And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better.

All right, so I'm going to pull my shoulders away from my ears and just lifting up squeezing my shoulder blades together. So I'm working my middle and lower traps and I'm coming down slowly and I'm releasing. Okay, one more time. Squeezing shoulder blades together pulling away from the ears and lifting up. Not very high is it just a little bit off the ground. Coming back down down slowly and releasing and coming back up so you can see that's starting to strengthen through the middle of the back. Now I do have an exercise video on stretching out the top muscles that will give you some temporary relief. You might like to see that there's a link below but otherwise start on a combination of stretching out those top muscles and strengthen through the middle and the lower back. I really hope today's video helps you start to strengthen and switch shop these top muscles and I'll see you next time. Thanks for watching.",

And the test we need to do to determine if the break-up flexes is the cause of your shoulder pain is what we call the ruse test. Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a",

Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would take that measurement and then divide it into two. So if you had four inches on the ruler, you would take an actually mark on your swab where two inches would be. So in this case, you would mark right about the junction of the thick portion of the swab narrowing down. In the case of the adult on this particular swab that works",

In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages.

I'm here today to help produce a video To help train people have to do correct nasopharyngeal swabs. My expertise in point of care testing has had me to obtain several thousand of these. So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting",

So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting better control. Sometimes with this less flexible shaft, especially in lower kids that you're only inserting in a small distance. There is not as much control and you tend to have a little more flex in the swab shaft causing it not to pick up cells quite as well. So I typically prefer this shaft over the lower one bed both work equally well",

Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

      "answer": "To address a crick in your neck, you can perform a simple maneuver that involves bending toward the side of discomfort. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Identify the Affected Side**: Determine which side of your neck is causing discomfort. This is crucial for the next steps.\n\n2. **Position Your Head**: Gently turn your head toward the affected side. For example, if your right side is painful, turn your head to the right. \n\n3. **Bend Backwards**: While your head is turned, slightly tilt it backward. This position can help relieve pressure on the nerves that may be pinched, which is often the cause of neck pain [Video 1: 01:48-01:54].\n\n4. **Monitor Pain Levels**: As you perform this maneuver, pay attention to any changes in pain. If the movement reproduces your shoulder pain or discomfort, it indicates that the issue may stem from your neck [Video 1: 02:13-02:19].\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: If you experience significant pain or if the discomfort persists, it\u2019s advisable to consult a healthcare professional. Avoid forcing any movements that cause sharp pain.\n\nThis approach can",

And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck. So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms,",

Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back.

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck.

So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck.

One is kind of a neck strain that you get from maybe lifting something too heavy or doing an exercise where you really kind of strain into your neck.

This setup helps support your neck and maintain proper alignment [Video 2: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 00:48-00:52].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Bend your knees for comfort, which also protects your lower back during the exercise [Video 2: h5MvX50zTLM, Time: 00:48-00:52].\n\n3. **Execution**: Tuck your chin in towards your chest gently.

And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades. And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one out is this one's going to be a little bit differently so again you're going to use your arm but this time is going to go up so you can either just raise your arm or I like to kind of put it back this way where my elbows",

      "answer": "To use ear drops effectively, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Have the person lie on their side with the affected ear facing upward. This position allows gravity to assist in the drops reaching the ear canal effectively [Video 1: v0HODFTrkqs, Time: 00:18-00:24].\n\n2. **Visual Access**: Gently pull the ear backward and upward to straighten the ear canal. This helps in visualizing the ear canal and ensures that the drops can enter properly.\n\n3. **Application**: Administer one drop into the ear canal. It\u2019s important to apply the drops carefully to avoid any spillage.\n\n4. **Facilitate Flow**: After applying each drop, press gently on the front of the ear. This action helps the drop to flow down towards the eardrum, maximizing its effectiveness [Video 1].\n\n5. **Repeat**: Continue applying drops as directed, ensuring that you follow the prescribed dosage.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always check the expiration date and ensure the drops are at room temperature before use. If there is any pain or discomfort, consult a healthcare professional.",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can. And we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet. So even after you blow it out and you feel like you may be empty, I'll",

You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

So let's go ahead and try it. Go ahead and put the nose clips on. I wanna be sure that you can't breathe through your nose. And this mouthpiece is like a snorkeling mouthpiece, so I need your lips over the outside portion of it and your teeth go behind it, teeth bind it on the two tabs. And just want to be sure, tongue is not including the hole in the mouthpiece. And just want you to begin with some normal breathing. All right, and I'll take a nasty breath in and blast it out. Keep blowing, keep blowing, keep going, you're doing great. Keep going, keep pushing out, keep pushing, and ghee, boi, shing. Take a fast, you breath on the way back in. It's great, you can come off that mouthpiece, and you can take those noseclubs off. As you can see, spirometry is an easy test to take.",

So let's go ahead and try it. Go ahead and put the nose clips on. I wanna be sure that you can't breathe through your nose. And this mouthpiece is like a snorkeling mouthpiece, so I need your lips over the outside portion of it and your teeth go behind it, teeth bind it on the two tabs. And just want to be sure, tongue is not including the hole in the mouthpiece. And just want you to begin with some normal breathing. All right, and I'll take a nasty breath in and blast it out. Keep blowing, keep blowing, keep going, you're doing great. Keep going, keep pushing out, keep pushing, and ghee, boi, shing. Take a fast, you breath on the way back in. It's great, you can come off that mouthpiece, and you can take those noseclubs off. As you can see, spirometry is an easy test to take. Talk to your provider about spirometry.",

A healthcare professional will provide you with a mouthpiece connected to the spirometer. You may also need to remove any nasal obstructions, such as nose clips [Video 2: Zs8Fs5HaJHs, Time: 02:47-02:50].\n\n3. **Performing the Test**: Take a deep breath in, then exhale forcefully into the mouthpiece.

The technician may encourage you to keep blowing until you can\u2019t anymore [Video 2: Zs8Fs5HaJHs, Time: 02:47-02:50].\n\n4. **Completion**: After the test, you can remove the mouth",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

      "answer": "To properly treat a foot sprain, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rest**: Limit movement and avoid putting weight on the injured foot. Resting is crucial for healing, so sit whenever possible [Video 1: bUgV89cdfTM, Time: 00:43-00:48].\n\n2. **Elevation**: Elevate your foot to the level of your chest. This helps reduce swelling by promoting fluid drainage from the injured area. Use pillows or cushions to support your foot while resting [Video 1].\n\n3. **Ice Application**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided videos, applying ice is a common recommendation for reducing swelling and pain in sprains. Ensure to wrap ice in a cloth to avoid direct contact with the skin.\n\n4. **Gradual Mobilization**: Once the initial pain and swelling decrease, gentle exercises can be introduced. For example, you can perform calf raises to strengthen the foot and improve mobility. Sit on a bench or chair with knees bent at about 90 degrees, pinch a tennis ball with your heels, and lift your heels while squeezing your calf muscles [Video 2: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 01:28-01:38; Video",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good.

That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

How do you know if you're doing the right neck exercises or stretches? Sure. This is very important because if you're doing the wrong one, it can make it worse. Absolutely. and such on the wrong direction quick. So the common causes of a pinch nerve in the neck are you could have a disc problem. You could have degeneration of the bones and to the point where they make the whole smaller where the nerves come out, or you could have thoracic outlets in them. That's where you get impenething between the collar bone and the first rib, right? So, and you could also just have compression of muscles. And in the neck, so there's more, but there's more. Yeah, I don't need the bore, that's right. So neck pain can vary in location intensity. It depends on your diagnosis, your age, and your posture. But the common locations are, and I guess we got kind of, we met them out. We met them out. This is for a pinch nerve, but it's very common to have neck pain, of course, up in the neck itself.

These can help reduce inflammation and discomfort before you start exercising [Video 1: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:36-02:41].\n\n3. **Avoid Counterproductive Movements**: Be cautious not to stretch or move in the direction opposite to the pain.

Instead, focus on gentle movements that do not exacerbate the pain [Video 1: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\n4. **Monitor Pain Levels**: As you perform exercises, pay close attention to your pain levels. If the pain decreases, the exercise may be effective. Conversely, if the pain worsens, stop the activity immediately.\n\n5. **Consult a Professional**: If pain",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

And the second way is when you have your head in a position and it can be either way where the pain in the neck can come from this part of the side of the neck where the muscles have been compressed in or too short or it can be from this side where the muscles are stretched in too long. It's usually this side, I find, in most of my patients. So you will also feel a lot of times with neck pain. You also feel it kind of going down into the shoulder blade. So you can kind of see here this muscle here, the levator scape kind of comes off the vertebrae and comes down out to the shoulder blade. So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good.

If you're struggling to hold each position for 10 seconds, repeat five times, what you do is do the A first for 10 seconds, then you move to the T, then you move to the Y, you hold each about 10 seconds and you give yourself a rest. I do 80 y again. A brilliant exercise to reduce the neck hump. Just a quick one. If you enjoy this first exercise, please unhazitate and comment in the box below. Give me thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. Okay, let's move on to the next exercise. So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time",

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already",

We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump.

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump. Often people who experience a neck hump or a buffalo hump also experience a bit of neck pain as well. I've done some",

So if you thought that the previous exercise was a very intense exercise to reduce your neck hump or your dowages hump, wait until you've tried this one. With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

This helps alleviate pressure on the neck area, which can contribute to the development of a neck hump [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 01:03-01:06].\n\n2. **Exercise Sequence**: The exercise involves three positions: A, T, and Y. Begin with the \"A\" position. Hold this position for 10 seconds. Focus on mobilizing and strengthening the lower part of your neck [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 03:27-03:32].\n\n3. **Transition**: After holding the \"A\" position, transition to the \"T\" position and hold for another 10 seconds. Finally, move to the \"Y\" position, maintaining it for 10 seconds as well.\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat the entire sequence five times. If you find it challenging to hold each position for 10 seconds, you can adjust the duration as needed but aim to complete the five repetitions [Video 1: fsdchGejKm",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

Ensure your shoulders are relaxed and your chin is tucked in to avoid dropping your head forward, which can exacerbate the neck hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n2. **Arm Movement**: Extend your arms back while keeping your elbows close to your sides. Aim to create an \"L\" shape with your arms, pulling them back to engage the shoulder muscles effectively [Video 3: T43753AfaKY, Time: 02:33-02:35].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for about 30 seconds, feeling the stretch across your shoulders and upper back. This helps alleviate tension in the neck area [Video 3].\n\n4. **Breathing**: Breathe deeply and steadily throughout the stretch to enhance relaxation and effectiveness.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Avoid pushing your head forward during the stretch, as this can increase strain on the neck and worsen the hump.

What I'm doing now is I'm supporting my elbow of the hand that holds my phone upright, suddenly my phone is upright, suddenly I'm not dropping my head forwards and not creating a lot of pressure on this area where I have my neck hump, phones upright, I can look at the phone this way, I'll create less pressure on the neck, and all the exercise that you do during the day, suddenly bare fruit, because you're taking away irritation throughout the day. So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure",

And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck. So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises.

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

This adjustment allows you to maintain a neutral spine and reduces the strain on your cervical spine. The video emphasizes that if you continue to look at your phone with your head dropped down, it can contribute to developing a neck hump, which is a common postural issue associated with prolonged phone use [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 07:20-07:23].\n\nAdditionally, the video notes that many individuals tend to look at their phones with their heads tilted forward, which exacerbates neck strain. By implementing the suggested hack of holding your phone higher, you can alleviate this pressure and promote better posture while using your device [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 06:58-07:03].\n\nIn summary, to minimize neck strain while using your cell phone, keep the device at eye level to maintain proper alignment and reduce the risk of developing postural issues.",
