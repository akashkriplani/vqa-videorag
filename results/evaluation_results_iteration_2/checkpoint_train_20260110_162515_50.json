So the simple solution to this problem is actually getting air to go through our your station tube into our middle ear space to regulate that pressure. Under normal circumstances, our ears will naturally unclog just by swallowing, but when swallowing isn't enough, you need to use a trick in order to get air through your you station tube into your middle ear space and the first one is called the Valsalva maneuver. Very simply the Valsalva maneuver is when you plug your nose and blow. That'll take air push it through your station tube into your middle ear space and it will regulate that pressure. If the Valsalva maneuver isn't getting the job done, then you may have to use our second technique which is the Lowry method. With the Lowry method, you basically do the same steps as you would with the Valsalva maneuver, but instead of just plugging your nose and blowing, you're plugging your nose blowing and swallowing at the same time, that sometimes gets extra air through your station tube and into your middle ear space. If you're not capable of doing those first two techniques, then the third technique is yawning, because when you yawning, it opens up those your station tubes just enough to let some air through. Technique number four is a little bit weird, but you could actually",

Hence in order to prevent the pain it's important that these muscles needs to be stretched on a regular basis. So now without wasting any due time let's understand how to perform these three stretches. The first stretch that you need to do is and calf muscle stretch. For this, you need to take the help of Thera Man and place it on your 4 foot. Now pull this Thera Man towards yourself. Hold this for 22 to 30 seconds and then relax. You need to perform this stretching exercise for 3 repetitions. The next stretch is for hamstring muscle, the muscle that lies behind your thigh. For this, place your leg over a stool, bend forward from the hip and try to touch your greater toe with the elbow hand. Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds and then relax. You need to perform this particular stretching exercise for three repetitions. And the third muscle that needs to be stretched is the quadricep muscle or the front time machine. For this, you need to stand straight with the help of some support and then bend your knee and try to touch your heel to the hips. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds and then relax. And perform this exercise for three repetitions. So friends, this is how you can stretch your leg muscles on a regular basis in order to prevent leg pain. I hope you found",

So we have a cardiac stress test to identify whether or not there's been any type of damage to the heart. All patients who come in for cardiac stress testing, independent of the type of tests that that they have, have to have a standard 12 lead kg, a less than 40-gram, to attach to them so that we can effectively monitor the rhythm of the heart. We have a number of cardiac stress tests that we perform. And a lot of it depends upon what we're looking for and the level of the patient's ability to perform a test. With our cardiac stress testing, obviously we try to get patients to perform exercise. Exercise is the best way to stimulate the heart and to get an accurate view of how hard it is responding. many situations of patient is not physically able to exercise, so we have to resort to using a chemical stress test, either in a denocene or a debuting, to simulate that activity of the heart to evaluate the function, the blood pressure of the heart rate, and the ECG changes if any of the cardiac stress test. We do probably anywhere from 10 to 15 cardiac stress test a day of a variety. Today, I think we're doing some half our tests or chemical. We",

I'm going to demonstrate how to perform acupressure at P6 for the treatment of nausea and vomiting. To locate this point, hold one hand, palm up. The point is located three finger widths below the wrist crease. Next, use your thumb and place it below the index finger between the two large tendons. Using firm pressure and a circular motion apply pressure to this point. You might feel a deep achy sensation but it should not be painful. This point can be used before meals as well as before going to each night. We recommend you use this point multiple times a day. Acupressure can be a beneficial self-care tool for multiple symptoms. However, in order to perform it safely, it's important to keep a few things in mind. Never do acupressure in areas with open cuts, always avoid pick lines and IV lines, and also always avoid areas with redness and swelling. . . . . . . .",

Ready? Go. Okay, good. Let me have you stay straight like that. Let me do it a whole more time. Good. And let's do it on the left side. Straight back. Go. Good. Okay. Now, you need to test internal and external rotators. And if you have pain that's chronic or acute and it's reproduced by external or internal rotator testing, that suggests that either as a primary or possibly as a secondary diagnosis you have rotaire cuff involvement and people typically will have pain on the lateral deltoid area. The maneuvers that reproduce the pain most strikingly are the rotaire cuff resistance exercises. I'm going to do it through the opposite. I'm going to have a thumbs point. There is a specific maneuver called superspinatus testing that shows reproduction of pain as consistent with the rotator cuff strength. So again rotator cuff strength can be reproduced with resisted internal rotation, external rotation, or super-spinatus testing. We do one examination for the biceps tendon. We have the patient's arm come up like this, and we put our finger right in here, and we have them do resistance this way. If they have paining anteriorly, especially if",

In this video, we're going to deal with tight, achy, dull, painful calves, and I'm going to break it down into a very easy three-part guide. In the first part, we're going to focus on a wonderful, self-massage technique. It might end up becoming your new favorite therapy. In the second part, we're going to get everything loosened up and moving with great stretching exercises for the calves. And third part we're going to focus on strengthening those calves with very easy to do exercises that may help lead to less instances of calf pain in the future. All these exercises can be done at home. Don't require any special equipment and may give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. So let's get started and get rid of that calf pain right now. In the first part, let's try to focus on getting instant pain relief into our calf muscles with what is called gouache or muscle scraping. It's a wonderful technique at getting rid of muscle tightness, muscle spasms, cramps, trigger points, you name it very easily and very effectively. We need two things. The first being a large metal spoon. I like one with a little bit more thickness. You'll get better results. The next is a form of lubrication. You can use any massage lotions or massage creams.",

So that is one of the other assistance we were doing looking at the tightness in my calf and we noticed my calf was pretty tight. So what can we do to kind of loosen that up and improve the mobility around the ankle? So one of the good things is to use a foam roller so if you want to pop down on the floor. So okay put your right ankle on the roller, keep your knee nice and straight and then put your left leg over the top and what you're going to do is slightly lift your bottom up in the air and roll up and down nice and slowly from the back of your knee towards your ankle and it should might be quite sore and tender in certain areas but should hopefully give some quite a good nice relief and we leave any tightness in that car. So, let's just loosen up my car with the foam roller, but when we're doing the functional test earlier, we notice that my car and my ankle are pretty weak, they're for too quickly and they didn't have much strength. What exercises can we do to increase the strength and endurance in my right side? Okay, so if you go hop on the step, it's similar to the way we assess it, you might have",

If you want to take this one to the next level, what you can do is stretch into it, but then pull forward even more with the door knob. So I'm using my hand right here at the door knob to pull myself forward even more. And this can become extremely intense of a stretch. So again, only to your comfort level. If you want to take this one even to the next level, move over to the door frame right here. open the door grab the back side of that door frame and pull yourself forward even more, but again only to your comfort level. Go through those take what is most effective and remember always switch to the other side to keep them both in balance.

The first being a form of lubrication, I'm going to be using coconut oil, but you You can also use massage creams or over the counter pain relief creams, such as biophrease or icy hot. Just make sure to coat the back of the neck, shoulders, upper back with the lubrication. And when it comes to lubrication, a little bit more is always better. The next thing I'm going to be using is a metal spoon. I like one that is a little bit thicker because you can just dig into the muscles a little bit more to hopefully get more relief. So let's go through different motions that might be causing that popping or snapping into the neck and get those worked out. I'm going to focus on basically doing a nice chin tuck like this while drawing my head forward to cause flexion into my neck. So my chin down, head is going forward like this.

There's dozens of types of calf stretches out there so you can look them up on YouTube or Google. Now, I'll recommend doing this exercise with your shoes off of that way. You can actually feel the ground and use a bit of proprioception and train your body to feel where your body is. Just a moment of tip for you guys to open up the joints. So put this arm straight through the inner part of your knee towards that outside of your foot. Put your foot down, press your elbow into your knee and open up your chest. Try to sit upright and open up your hips a lot more. Just a moment of tip when you guys do as well is actually leaning different angles in this position. So what I want you to do is actually lean to side to side, so let's say on lean to 45 degrees, all we're there for about 10 to 30 seconds, and then go to the other side as well. And then go to more on a horizontal plane, and hold there for up 20 to 30 seconds as well. And then go to the other side for now that way you'll open up a lot of your joints and stretch a lot of the muscles that don't really get stretched in weight",

The first being a large metal spoon. I like one with a little bit more thickness. You'll get better results. The next is a form of lubrication. You can use any massage lotions or massage creams. You can even use pain relief creams such as biophrees or icy hot, just coat pretty much from the knee all the way down to the ankle front and back. And when it comes to lubrication a little bit more is always better. So after we've done that, what I'm going to do is take my spoon. It doesn't really matter what part of the spoon you take. I find that using the handle is a little bit easier, but you can use the rounded portion here to actually experiment with it, take what is most effective. But what I'm going to do is start at the bottom of the leg right at the ankle. And when you do this, make sure to only go over soft tissue muscle that you can grab on to skin, stay off any bony spots like this because that can cause irritation and we definitely don't want that. So I'm going to take my spoon and I'm going to use the handle right here and put it at about a 30 degree angle and I'm going to press into the point where there's enough pressure that",

In this video, I'm going to show you a step-by-step guide that are going to go over stretching and strengthening exercises to give quick heel pain relief even in as little as 30 seconds. All of these exercises can be done at home. They're very easy and effective and don't require any special equipment. The only thing that I'm going to be using in one of the exercises is an everyday tennis ball. So, let's get started and get rid of that heel pain right now. In this part, we're going to focus on a big cause of heel pain, which is soft tissue tightness, notably planar fasciitis. This is known as gouachea, and it might become your new favorite exercise. We need two things, the first being a form of lubrication. I'm going to be using coconut oil, but you can use any over-the-counter pain cream, such as icy hat or biofreeze or any massage locians. Start off by coating this whole area also with our lubrication. When it comes to lubrication, we want as much as possible that way we don't have any friction. The second thing that we need is a large metal spoon. One with a little bit more thickness towards it, you'll get a little bit better result. So after we put our lubrication on, what I'm going to do",

So what I like to do is press for my heel into the floor and then I'm going to just take my toes upwards towards the ceiling. What this will do is activate that calf muscle. So again, start to go over that and you may find that new spots of tightness have formed or new spots of pain can be targeted so really dig in there and try to loosen that up. I also like to do a little bit more ankle motion. So what I'm going to do is turn my ankle inward, repeat that and then once I'm done with that I'm going to turn my ankle outwards and then repeat that also because this just activates that calf muscle just a little bit differently. But go through all of those motions, go through all of the areas, target spots of the heat, or any spots that you feel are tight and achy, try to loosen that up and I hope that that gives you a lot of quick calf pain relief. In the second part, let's focus on getting rid of calf muscle pain with some wonderful stretching exercises. Let's just get everything loosened up. This first exercise is called a calf rock back, it's very easy to do. We're going to start off on all fours on the floor just like this. From",

      "answer": "To loosen up tight calf muscles using a metal spoon and lubrication, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Start by selecting a suitable lubricant, such as lotion or oil, to apply to your calf muscles. This will help the spoon glide smoothly over the skin, reducing friction and enhancing comfort during the process.\n\n2. **Application**: Take the metal spoon and apply it to the tight areas of your calf. Use the rounded edge of the spoon to gently massage the muscle. Begin at the lower part of the calf and work your way up towards the knee, applying moderate pressure. Be cautious not to apply too much pressure, as this could cause discomfort or bruising.\n\n3. **Technique**: Use long, sweeping motions with the spoon, focusing on any knots or tight spots. You can also use circular motions to further loosen the muscle fibers. This technique helps to increase blood flow and relieve tension in the calf muscles.\n\n4. **Duration**: Spend about 5-10 minutes on each calf, ensuring you listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain.\n\nAlways consult with a healthcare professional if you have underlying conditions or persistent pain before trying new techniques for muscle relief [Video 1: PoSgyRG27-E",

So that is one of the other assistance we were doing looking at the tightness in my calf and we noticed my calf was pretty tight. So what can we do to kind of loosen that up and improve the mobility around the ankle? So one of the good things is to use a foam roller so if you want to pop down on the floor. So okay put your right ankle on the roller, keep your knee nice and straight and then put your left leg over the top and what you're going to do is slightly lift your bottom up in the air and roll up and down nice and slowly from the back of your knee towards your ankle and it should might be quite sore and tender in certain areas but should hopefully give some quite a good nice relief and we leave any tightness in that car. So, let's just loosen up my car with the foam roller, but when we're doing the functional test earlier, we notice that my car and my ankle are pretty weak, they're for too quickly and they didn't have much strength. What exercises can we do to increase the strength and endurance in my right side? Okay, so if you go hop on the step, it's similar to the way we assess it, you might have",

So just getting that nice stretch, feeling like you're really getting it loosened up in there. So we're going to take a little 10 second break to go into the next stretch. And the next stretch is going to be a solely a stretch. The solelyest muscle is one underneath the calf. And so bending your knee helps you get that stretch. So you can still do this sitting down in a chair, bring your heel back, but keep it on the floor. So not coming up like this. Just go until it feels tight and then lean into it. And if you can go back a little bit more and get that stretch. So I'm now stretching that solace because my knee is bent and taking the calf muscle out of it. So the calf, when you're stretching calf muscles or those gas drops, you want your knee to be straight. But when you're stretching the solace, you want to bend that knee a little bit. So stretch it out a little bit and then go back into it. Try and keeping the heel down is the most important part. And this might not look like a lot, but I'm",

All you need to do is sit with the leg straight and try to touch your great toe with the hand. Here you will feel a pull around the calf region. 3 repetitions for each leg wide holding it for 30 counts. If you find the previous method difficult, you can take the help of a Theraband, a belt or even a basic towel or matri-troid. Just place your foot on the Therabad, as shown in the screen about, and then try to pull your foot towards yourself while holding this for 30 seconds. As you hold and then release, it will lead to the stretching of the calf region. Here we are doing the stretching of E.V.T. wheelband. This is a structure that lies on the side of a thigh region. You need to put your leg on the theraband or any belt that you are using and then keeping a knee straight, move the leg towards the internal direction. You need to hold each position for 30 counts, and for each leg you can do three repetitions, and don't forget to do the six size for both the legs. Since most feet, whenever we have pain in one side of the leg we tend to put more pressure on the other side, leading to more tightness and stiffness on the the other side muscles",

So just doing a couple of those just to get the muscle ready to go and then we're going to go into the first stretch which is a calf stretch. For the calf stretch I like to kind of profit up if you're on your couch or your bed you can just hang it off the edge you'll have to do it on the floor and then just take a strap right kind of above the ball of the foot and pull towards you so you're not actively moving the foot you're using the strap you can use a dog leash you can use a belt to pull in and you should feel that stretch right under there where that calf muscle is the actually crosses that knee joint so that's why it's really important so now just a little break in between and then go back into that stretch so this is the second 30 seconds stretch now. So again the calf muscles are that gastrochmuscle comes up it's attached that Achilles tendon comes up and crosses that knee joint. So if it's tight it's going to cause pressure and pain in that knee if it's not doing what it's supposed to do. So this",

In this video, we're going to deal with tight, achy, dull, painful calves, and I'm going to break it down into a very easy three-part guide. In the first part, we're going to focus on a wonderful, self-massage technique. It might end up becoming your new favorite therapy. In the second part, we're going to get everything loosened up and moving with great stretching exercises for the calves. And third part we're going to focus on strengthening those calves with very easy to do exercises that may help lead to less instances of calf pain in the future. All these exercises can be done at home. Don't require any special equipment and may give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. So let's get started and get rid of that calf pain right now. In the first part, let's try to focus on getting instant pain relief into our calf muscles with what is called gouache or muscle scraping. It's a wonderful technique at getting rid of muscle tightness, muscle spasms, cramps, trigger points, you name it very easily and very effectively. We need two things. The first being a large metal spoon. I like one with a little bit more thickness. You'll get better results. The next is a form of lubrication. You can use any massage lotions or massage creams.",

And when it comes to leg muscles there are three important muscles that needs to be stretched over and over again, in order to maintain good flexibility and momentum. Quarters of muscles, also called as strength hypnosis, hamstring muscle, also called as your path hypnosis and your calf muscle. These three muscles are always at higher risk of developing tightness and this tightness needs to abnormal movement patterns or is limited mobility in the muscles and when you try to do some activity at that time this limited mobility can lead to further injury and damage and causes pain.

But you can also stretch it actively too if you don't have any equipment to do it. So really just put your leg out in front of you again, try and keep your knee straight and just pull your toes towards you. So I feel a little bit in my quad because you're activating your quad to straighten out your knee. But when you pull your toes up, you're going to feel that calf stretch in there. So you don't necessarily have to do it passively. Sometimes that's better to get a bigger stretch. But you can just pull it towards you and you should really feel that stretch as well. Again, I'm feeling it in my quads because I'm activating everything. But as I pull my toes up, I'm gonna feel it in the calves. And that's really kind of what you wanna feel is that active calf stretch. And so it's nice. And then even if you wanna put your leg down, you don't have to hold it up because that'll maybe take the quad out of it a little bit. But I'm pulling those toes up towards me. And I should feel it right in through here. I might fill in the back of my knee because those calf muscles cross that knee joint. So wherever you feel",

There's dozens of types of calf stretches out there so you can look them up on YouTube or Google. Now, I'll recommend doing this exercise with your shoes off of that way. You can actually feel the ground and use a bit of proprioception and train your body to feel where your body is. Just a moment of tip for you guys to open up the joints. So put this arm straight through the inner part of your knee towards that outside of your foot. Put your foot down, press your elbow into your knee and open up your chest. Try to sit upright and open up your hips a lot more. Just a moment of tip when you guys do as well is actually leaning different angles in this position. So what I want you to do is actually lean to side to side, so let's say on lean to 45 degrees, all we're there for about 10 to 30 seconds, and then go to the other side as well. And then go to more on a horizontal plane, and hold there for up 20 to 30 seconds as well. And then go to the other side for now that way you'll open up a lot of your joints and stretch a lot of the muscles that don't really get stretched in weight",

This position helps isolate the calf muscles effectively.\n\n2. **Stretching**: Reach forward with your hands to touch your great toe. This action will create a stretch in your calf muscles. Ensure that you feel a gentle pull around the calf region, which indicates that the muscles are being effectively stretched [Video 2: P9AstEWm3vo, Time: 01:57-02:01].\n\n3. **Repetitions**: Perform this stretch for 3 repetitions on each leg. Hold each stretch for a few seconds to maximize the benefits.\n\n4. **Mobility Consideration**: It's important to note that tightness in the calf can often be linked to stiffness in the ankle joint. Therefore, incorporating mobility exercises for the ankle may also be beneficial in conjunction with calf stretches [Video 1: Sm1p5jBp2cQ, Time: 07:24-07:29].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always listen to your body and avoid pushing into pain. If you experience sharp discomfort, ease off",

Here you will feel a pull around the calf region. 3 repetitions for each leg wide holding it for 30 counts. If you find the previous method difficult, you can take the help of a Theraband, a belt or even a basic towel or matri-troid. Just place your foot on the Therabad, as shown in the screen about, and then try to pull your foot towards yourself while holding this for 30 seconds. As you hold and then release, it will lead to the stretching of the calf region. Here we are doing the stretching of E.V.T. wheelband. This is a structure that lies on the side of a thigh region. You need to put your leg on the theraband or any belt that you are using and then keeping a knee straight, move the leg towards the internal direction. You need to hold each position for 30 counts, and for each leg you can do three repetitions, and don't forget to do the six size for both the legs. Since most feet, whenever we have pain in one side of the leg we tend to put more pressure on the other side, leading to more tightness and stiffness on the the other side muscles",

So just getting that nice stretch, feeling like you're really getting it loosened up in there. So we're going to take a little 10 second break to go into the next stretch. And the next stretch is going to be a solely a stretch. The solelyest muscle is one underneath the calf. And so bending your knee helps you get that stretch. So you can still do this sitting down in a chair, bring your heel back, but keep it on the floor. So not coming up like this. Just go until it feels tight and then lean into it. And if you can go back a little bit more and get that stretch. So I'm now stretching that solace because my knee is bent and taking the calf muscle out of it. So the calf, when you're stretching calf muscles or those gas drops, you want your knee to be straight. But when you're stretching the solace, you want to bend that knee a little bit.

I call this the calf smashing circuit and if your calf had a butt, this would kick it. So I'm going to step up onto that stair or that yoga block to the point where my heels are going to be off, my toes are going to be on. If you are in a stair case, just take your hands grab off to the side right here on those walls for support. If you are doing the next tool wall, just grab onto it like this. What I'm going to do first is a simple calf raise that is just lifting up with my feet trying to take my heels up towards the ceiling. Try to focus on feeling and activating those calf muscles through all of these exercises you should really feel it into the calves. So what you want to do is go to a comfortable point of activation of those muscles hold this for five seconds from there, come back down, relax, take a breather, and then repeat this up to 10 times.

In this video, we're going to deal with tight, achy, dull, painful calves, and I'm going to break it down into a very easy three-part guide. In the first part, we're going to focus on a wonderful, self-massage technique. It might end up becoming your new favorite therapy. In the second part, we're going to get everything loosened up and moving with great stretching exercises for the calves. And third part we're going to focus on strengthening those calves with very easy to do exercises that may help lead to less instances of calf pain in the future. All these exercises can be done at home. Don't require any special equipment and may give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. So let's get started and get rid of that calf pain right now. In the first part, let's try to focus on getting instant pain relief into our calf muscles with what is called gouache or muscle scraping. It's a wonderful technique at getting rid of muscle tightness, muscle spasms, cramps, trigger points, you name it very easily and very effectively. We need two things. The first being a large metal spoon. I like one with a little bit more thickness. You'll get better results. The next is a form of lubrication. You can use any massage lotions or massage creams.",

Just put this strap kind of at the ball of your foot, pull your leg out a little bit so your knee is locked out, and then just pull towards you. So I'm getting that stretch in that calf muscle that comes all the way up and crosses my knee too. But that calf muscle has a lot to do with us pushing off on our foot. So when you're pulling it this way, you're really stretching it out, and that has a lot to do with ankle pain. So if you You have ankle pain. This is a great stretch to do. So take a little relax, and then we're gonna stretch that 30 seconds again. You can do this, lying down. You can do it sitting like we're doing, or you can do it standing. There's a whole bunch of different ways to stretch the calf. And I've got a lot of videos where you can see that. So again, you're not pulling your toes up actively. You're using the strap or the belt or the dog leash to pull that up for you. So just getting that nice stretch, feeling like you're",

These exercises involve you wearing shoes are going to have a firm last in the shoe or like a jogger and being near a wall. So our first stretch involves you getting your heel really close to the wall and your toe upright against the wall. So get your heel in as close as your can. So the you stretch the muscles down through the calf and into the arch of your foot that includes the planofascia. So bring your body now up, bring your hips close and if you can bring your pelvis forward or your hips close to the wall and come up on the back toe to increase that stretch. Some of you will need to start with the foot down flat but to increase the stretch come in close and hold it. Now push down through your heel and make sure that your knee is straight to get that deep stretch into your calf and you might even feel it into the arch of your foot. Hold it there, try to relax your breathing and ideally you're holding that stretch for 30 seconds at a time, and let's take it back down. Now the second stretch is a variation, that stretch. We're going to bring the healing closer to the wall, but turn the toe outwards. All right, so the toes turned out, now keeping the legs",

So that is one of the other assistance we were doing looking at the tightness in my calf and we noticed my calf was pretty tight. So what can we do to kind of loosen that up and improve the mobility around the ankle? So one of the good things is to use a foam roller so if you want to pop down on the floor. So okay put your right ankle on the roller, keep your knee nice and straight and then put your left leg over the top and what you're going to do is slightly lift your bottom up in the air and roll up and down nice and slowly from the back of your knee towards your ankle and it should might be quite sore and tender in certain areas but should hopefully give some quite a good nice relief and we leave any tightness in that car. So, let's just loosen up my car with the foam roller, but when we're doing the functional test earlier, we notice that my car and my ankle are pretty weak, they're for too quickly and they didn't have much strength. What exercises can we do to increase the strength and endurance in my right side? Okay, so if you go hop on the step, it's similar to the way we assess it, you might have",

So again this one you don't have to hold it like you would sometimes in the exercise I'm talking about. The a quad set is you're just squeezing that quad and relaxing it. So just doing a couple of those just to get the muscle ready to go and then we're going to go into the first stretch which is a calf stretch. For the calf stretch I like to kind of profit up if you're on your couch or your bed you can just hang it off the edge you'll have to do it on the floor and then just take a strap right kind of above the ball of the foot and pull towards you so you're not actively moving the foot you're using the strap you can use a dog leash you can use a belt to pull in and you should feel that stretch right under there where that calf muscle is the actually crosses that knee joint so that's why it's really important so now just a little break in between and then go back into that stretch so this is the second 30 seconds stretch now. So again the calf muscles are that gastrochmuscle comes up it's attached that Achilles tendon comes up and crosses that knee joint. So if it's tight it's going to cause pressure and pain in that knee if it's not doing what it's supposed to do. So this",

There's dozens of types of calf stretches out there so you can look them up on YouTube or Google. Now, I'll recommend doing this exercise with your shoes off of that way. You can actually feel the ground and use a bit of proprioception and train your body to feel where your body is. Just a moment of tip for you guys to open up the joints. So put this arm straight through the inner part of your knee towards that outside of your foot. Put your foot down, press your elbow into your knee and open up your chest. Try to sit upright and open up your hips a lot more. Just a moment of tip when you guys do as well is actually leaning different angles in this position. So what I want you to do is actually lean to side to side, so let's say on lean to 45 degrees, all we're there for about 10 to 30 seconds, and then go to the other side as well. And then go to more on a horizontal plane, and hold there for up 20 to 30 seconds as well. And then go to the other side for now that way you'll open up a lot of your joints and stretch a lot of the muscles that don't really get stretched in weight",

The front leg should be slightly bent.\n\n3. **Stretching**: Lean forward into the wall, ensuring that your back leg remains straight. You should feel a stretch in the calf muscle of the back leg. Hold this position for 15-30 seconds.\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Repeat the stretch 3 times for each leg to maximize the benefits and alleviate tightness [Video 1: P9AstEWm3vo, Time: 01:57-02:01].\n\n**Safety Notes**: Ensure that your back heel stays on the ground during the stretch to effectively target the calf muscles. Avoid bouncing or forcing the stretch, as this can lead to injury. If you feel sharp pain, ease off the stretch immediately [Video 2: PoSgyRG27-E, Time: 08:53-08:56].",

This one is best done next to a staircase but you can You can also use something like a yoga block and I'll get grief for this, but you can use a stack of hardcover books or just a block of wood. I call this the calf smashing circuit and if your calf had a butt, this would kick it. So I'm going to step up onto that stair or that yoga block to the point where my heels are going to be off, my toes are going to be on. If you are in a stair case, just take your hands grab off to the side right here on those walls for support. If you are doing the next tool wall, just grab onto it like this. What I'm going to do first is a simple calf raise that is just lifting up with my feet trying to take my heels up towards the ceiling. Try to focus on feeling and activating those calf muscles through all of these exercises you should really feel it into the calves. So what you want to do is go to a comfortable point of activation of those muscles hold this for five seconds from there, come back down, relax, take a breather, and then repeat this up to 10 times. Each repetition really focus on driving up",

In this video, we're going to deal with tight, achy, dull, painful calves, and I'm going to break it down into a very easy three-part guide. In the first part, we're going to focus on a wonderful, self-massage technique. It might end up becoming your new favorite therapy. In the second part, we're going to get everything loosened up and moving with great stretching exercises for the calves. And third part we're going to focus on strengthening those calves with very easy to do exercises that may help lead to less instances of calf pain in the future. All these exercises can be done at home. Don't require any special equipment and may give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. So let's get started and get rid of that calf pain right now. In the first part, let's try to focus on getting instant pain relief into our calf muscles with what is called gouache or muscle scraping. It's a wonderful technique at getting rid of muscle tightness, muscle spasms, cramps, trigger points, you name it very easily and very effectively. We need two things. The first being a large metal spoon. I like one with a little bit more thickness. You'll get better results. The next is a form of lubrication. You can use any massage lotions or massage creams.",

With each repetition, try to drive your body weight forward even more, because it will only help stretch those caps out and hopefully lead to more pain and tightness relief. If you want to take this one to the next level, what you can do is stretch into it, but then pull forward even more with the door knob. So I'm using my hand right here at the door knob to pull myself forward even more. And this can become extremely intense of a stretch. So again, only to your comfort level. If you want to take this one even to the next level, move over to the door frame right here. open the door grab the back side of that door frame and pull yourself forward even more, but again only to your comfort level. Go through those take what is most effective and remember always switch to the other side to keep them both in balance. So without a doubt if we want to get rid of calf pain for good we have to strengthen all of those muscles to hopefully future prove them from pain and tightness.

It is accurate, minimally invasive, much less painful and mathematically appealing. A camera is introduced through a puncture one to visualizer in surgery. The repair is performed by placing anchors in the bone, passing switchers through the tendon, and securing the switchers to the bone. In sensation of the camera through a small puncture wound allows excellent visualization. Instruments are used to pass switchers from the bone anchors through the tendon. The repair is completed by further securing the switches and tendon to bone. The completed repair is shown to demonstrate the secure fixation of the torn tendon to bone.

Once you're out of the cast, then out of the boot, then still walking in the brace in the shoe. You need to stretch your lower back, your hips, your hamstring, the back of your knees, your calf muscles. What we usually see is people heal their bone completely, but they're so tight and scarred up and stiff that they're in having pain 6 to 12 months later. Maybe even more. Nobody really wants to go to physical therapy because the copays can be so high these days. highly, highly recommended. If not, you stretching devices. I love ankle stretch boards, but watch this stretching video right here. This will help a ton. Everyone always wants to know exercise. So here it is, a massage roller stick. This is $10 or less, online. Check the show notes. But you have to massage out your calf muscle. Your killies tended, even your planar fascia. Study show that doing this for 30 to 60 seconds per muscle group gives you a few hours of relaxed and flexible muscles. So even for the planar fascia, I love to massage the planar fascia. The idea is you're squeezing the fluid out of the ligaments, the tendons in your foot, in your calf muscle. So the ball doesn't work great anywhere except the bottom of your foot. You want to use the massage roller stick. I was",

So what you want to do is go to a comfortable point of activation of those muscles hold this for five seconds from there, come back down, relax, take a breather, and then repeat this up to 10 times. Each repetition really focus on driving up even more to challenge yourself to help strengthen those muscles. From there we want to do the opposite. So let's go all the way up and then do a heel drop. That is just slowly coming down to the point where my heels are going down towards the floor. Do let them touch the floor though. Just let them hover. This should take you about five seconds from going to the top all the way down to the bottom and really fight gravity and your body weight. What you want to do for this one is 10 complete repetitions. If this becomes too easy, what you can do from there is just take one leg off and then repeat those exercises. It'll definitely become more challenging because you have more body weight to deal with. Once you're done with that, what we want is to focus on more dynamic movements, challenge those muscles through different motions. What I'm going to do is what is called an eccentric calf raise. So I'm going to tilt my body just a little bit towards one direction, in this case my right. And then I'm going",

So again, start to go over that and you may find that new spots of tightness have formed or new spots of pain can be targeted so really dig in there and try to loosen that up. I also like to do a little bit more ankle motion. So what I'm going to do is turn my ankle inward, repeat that and then once I'm done with that I'm going to turn my ankle outwards and then repeat that also because this just activates that calf muscle just a little bit differently. But go through all of those motions, go through all of the areas, target spots of the heat, or any spots that you feel are tight and achy, try to loosen that up and I hope that that gives you a lot of quick calf pain relief. In the second part, let's focus on getting rid of calf muscle pain with some wonderful stretching exercises. Let's just get everything loosened up. This first exercise is called a calf rock back, it's very easy to do. We're going to start off on all fours on the floor just like this. From",

From there what you can do is go forward and backward with your weight cause it'll activate the muscles a little bit differently and you can also do a circular hool-hool-hool motion. But focus on trying to drive the knees out as much as you can. Focus on movements that feel just a little bit more weak and throw more repetitions in there to help strengthen the pelvis and hopefully get rid of that pelvic pain for good.

          "text": "Hi everyone, Bob is here with another video. If you're experiencing back pain, one of the way that can improve your symptoms can be strengthening your core. Today I would like to share with you a couple of exercises that can help you to improve your core strength. These exercises can be done at home without any equipment. Let's go to them. Before I show you the exercises, I would like to explain for you what is core meanings. Core muscles are a group of muscle that extend beyond our only abs and our torso. They're basically involved in most of the movements that we do. Core muscles are dynamic and the static stabilizer of movement. They are basically help us to create force from one extremity to another and in some cases, they create movement. At the end of this video, you will learn more about core muscles and how they can help you to improve your symptoms. Let's go through the first exercise and you can see how you can start your routine. The first exercise that I would like to share with you guys is going to be back extension. This exercise will strengthen your lower back, your erected spinal which is the muscle that goes along your back from neck all the way down to your sacrum. And also you can engage your glute muscle which can actually help you to strengthen both at the same time. Let's go to the exercise and we can progress them step-by-step. Now, the first reason",

      "answer": "To strengthen your calf muscles and relieve calf pain using a yoga block, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Setup**: Position a yoga block on the ground. Stand facing the block, ensuring you have enough space to move comfortably.\n\n2. **Foot Placement**: Place the balls of your feet on the edge of the yoga block, allowing your heels to hang off. This position helps to engage your calf muscles effectively.\n\n3. **Calf Raises**: Slowly rise onto your toes, lifting your heels as high as possible. Hold this position for a moment to maximize the contraction in your calf muscles.\n\n4. **Lowering**: Gradually lower your heels back down below the level of the block. This eccentric movement is crucial for strengthening the calf muscles and improving flexibility.\n\n5. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10-15 repetitions, and perform 2-3 sets. This exercise should be done regularly to help prevent future calf pain and tightness.\n\n**Safety Note**: Ensure that you maintain balance while performing this exercise to avoid falls. If you feel any sharp pain, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional [Video 1: PoSgyRG27-E, Time: 08:53-08:56",

In this video, we're going to deal with tight, achy, dull, painful calves, and I'm going to break it down into a very easy three-part guide. In the first part, we're going to focus on a wonderful, self-massage technique. It might end up becoming your new favorite therapy. In the second part, we're going to get everything loosened up and moving with great stretching exercises for the calves. And third part we're going to focus on strengthening those calves with very easy to do exercises that may help lead to less instances of calf pain in the future. All these exercises can be done at home. Don't require any special equipment and may give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. So let's get started and get rid of that calf pain right now. In the first part, let's try to focus on getting instant pain relief into our calf muscles with what is called gouache or muscle scraping. It's a wonderful technique at getting rid of muscle tightness, muscle spasms, cramps, trigger points, you name it very easily and very effectively. We need two things. The first being a large metal spoon. I like one with a little bit more thickness. You'll get better results. The next is a form of lubrication. You can use any massage lotions or massage creams.",

So what I like to do is press for my heel into the floor and then I'm going to just take my toes upwards towards the ceiling. What this will do is activate that calf muscle. So again, start to go over that and you may find that new spots of tightness have formed or new spots of pain can be targeted so really dig in there and try to loosen that up. I also like to do a little bit more ankle motion. So what I'm going to do is turn my ankle inward, repeat that and then once I'm done with that I'm going to turn my ankle outwards and then repeat that also because this just activates that calf muscle just a little bit differently. But go through all of those motions, go through all of the areas, target spots of the heat, or any spots that you feel are tight and achy, try to loosen that up and I hope that that gives you a lot of quick calf pain relief. In the second part, let's focus on getting rid of calf muscle pain with some wonderful stretching exercises. Let's just get everything loosened up. This first exercise is called a calf rock back, it's very easy to do. We're going to start off on all fours on the floor just like this. From",

Just put this strap kind of at the ball of your foot, pull your leg out a little bit so your knee is locked out, and then just pull towards you. So I'm getting that stretch in that calf muscle that comes all the way up and crosses my knee too. But that calf muscle has a lot to do with us pushing off on our foot. So when you're pulling it this way, you're really stretching it out, and that has a lot to do with ankle pain. So if you You have ankle pain. This is a great stretch to do. So take a little relax, and then we're gonna stretch that 30 seconds again. You can do this, lying down. You can do it sitting like we're doing, or you can do it standing. There's a whole bunch of different ways to stretch the calf. And I've got a lot of videos where you can see that. So again, you're not pulling your toes up actively.

Whatever side they were focusing on, let's say that I have a little bit more off to my right. I'm going to lift my left leg up, keep my right leg straight, and then just place my foot over the calf muscle on the right side just like this. What I want to do from there is a rocking motion, so I'm going to rock forward, that is with my whole body, is one complete movement, rocking forward by driving through my toes. When you do this, you're going to feel the muscles into that calf really start to fire, really focus on that as much as you can, you want to feel it into the calves. But hold this position for about three to five seconds. From there, you're going to try to then take the heel towards the floor.

And when it comes to leg muscles there are three important muscles that needs to be stretched over and over again, in order to maintain good flexibility and momentum. Quarters of muscles, also called as strength hypnosis, hamstring muscle, also called as your path hypnosis and your calf muscle. These three muscles are always at higher risk of developing tightness and this tightness needs to abnormal movement patterns or is limited mobility in the muscles and when you try to do some activity at that time this limited mobility can lead to further injury and damage and causes pain. Hence in order to prevent the pain it's important that these muscles needs to be stretched on a regular basis.

          "text": "sit on it. So, if you're finding this exercise a bit too hard, it's because your calf muscles are a bit too tight. So I do recommend you do some calf stretches. There's dozens of types of calf stretches out there so you can look them up on YouTube or Google. Now, I'll recommend doing this exercise with your shoes off of that way. You can actually feel the ground and use a bit of proprioception and train your body to feel where your body is. Just a moment of tip for you guys to open up the joints. So put this arm straight through the inner part of your knee towards that outside of your foot. Put your foot down, press your elbow into your knee and open up your chest. Try to sit upright and open up your hips a lot more. Just a moment of tip when you guys do as well is actually leaning different angles in this position. So what I want you to do is actually lean to side to side, so let's say on lean to 45 degrees, all we're there for about 10 to 30 seconds, and then go to the other side as well. And then go to more on a horizontal plane, and hold there for up 20 to 30 seconds as well. And then go to the other side for now that way you'll open up a lot of your joints and stretch a lot of the muscles that don't really get stretched in weight",

The general of physical therapy science released the paper on the effects of self mobilization techniques for psych nerves on physical functions and health of low back pain patients with lower limb radiating pain.

We want a pair to have much larger improvement with physical function and general health compared to group 2. Hence why are highly recommend doing stretches and exercises to help you have pain relief and improve your health. So please try out the back exercises on this channel as well. Seated peripheral stretch. Sitting a chair with your feet on the floor and your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. Then raise the leg that you want to stretch up and cross the ankle over to opposite knee. Grab the knee that you would like to stretch with your opposite hand and draw it towards your shoulder. Now allow your body to bend forward and the controlled and relaxed metal and take 10 deep long breaths or hold this position for 30 seconds. Repeat this three to four times. On each side, body weighted the piriformist stretch. Turn your body to the side so that your leg on the side you are trying to stretch leads flat onto the chair",

Here is a great stretching and strengthening exercise for the calf muscle and the bottom of the foot, the planar fascia, two big instigators of heel pain.

Whatever side that we're focusing on, take a small towel and place it underneath the toes and the ball of the foot so we want the toes elevated and the foot is going to be flat during this whole exercise. I'm going to keep the knee locked for the first part. Let's take our body weight and then just lunge forward while keeping that foot flat. If you need a little bit more support, you can go next to a door or a wall or use a chair off to the side, challenge yourself to lean forward as much as you can while again keeping that foot flat. You're going to feel a great stretch into the calf muscle into the bottom of the foot. Once we hit that great stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds from there, simply relax, take a breather, and then repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, challenge yourself to go forward even more to get a better stretch, hopefully leading to a lot more heel pain, believe. In the second part, I'm going to bend the knee very slightly and then repeat this exercise keeping that foot flat. You'll notice that this hits the calf muscle just",

If you're doing an exercise and it's increasing your symptoms or causing more discomfort, it's not a good exercise. When it comes to low backs, the rule is not no pain, no gain. If you're feeling pain, you should avoid that activity. And if none of these modifications, whether it's the ice or the activity limitation, avoiding flexion or doing your cat count, if that's not helping to alleviate your symptoms as a important use, you seek professional help. Alright, we hope you enjoyed this video and if you did, please like it and share it with a friend. Also, if you'd like to get a PDF of specific exercises to relieve herniated discs as well as low back pain, we can send you that PDF right away. There's going to be a link to that somewhere here on the video, or there's going to be a link in the description below to get that PDF.

So about 30 reps of this, but again don't feel limited to 30, if you can get 40, 50, 60 of these, feel free to do that. Start conservatively, maybe start with 30, and then progress up from there. As soon as you feel like okay, that's feeling strong, that can take this to the next level, jump on a stair, and we'll have to jump on a stair. But you're going to stand on the edge of a stair, and now just let your heels fall below the level of the stair, and then use your calf muscles to get up onto your toes, let your heels fall all the way down below the level of the stair, and then use your calf muscles to raise up on your toes. What you're doing there is just introducing more range of motion. So from here, I'm going from basically",

I recently had an ACL injury, probably the most devastating injury I've had and you know the most difficult and having that injury kind of broke me down and it made me have to start at zero again. Females are eight times more likely to sustain an ACL injury compared to males. To help prevent these ACL injuries from happening, there are things you can do. We're going to demonstrate today. Seven exercises that you can perform to stay on the field. Exercise number one, your basic squat. Ally is going to drop back like she's sitting in a chair. Knees do not come forward. Hip, straw, back, head stays up. Drive up through the heels. And the first movement was not to bend at the knees, but actually drop the hips back. Head and shoulders come forward. and she dries back up through the heels. Exercise number two, jump squat, knees hip, foot stays aligned. She's gonna generate upper body power, load up. She's gonna jump up, soft landing. Drops back on the heels into a seated position. Exercise number three, the lateral bound. Same technique as a squat. Everything stays aligned.

Now, you were going to show that the squat with the band on? Oh, yeah. I mean, so yep, you can get the band on like this. And then, just hold out, and if you wanted to do a, you know, this is for the more advanced. Sure, now you're going to double work out. Right. And I'm trying to get the squat in your work.

What you want to do is not do what you're just about to do. It's our ACL sitting right here. And so what you don't want to do is put any forces behind the leg here.

This is going to help you anchor down your upper body and allow you back to decompress as you lean back and allow your weight to stretch out your lumbar rectus. With this stretch I don't want you to just sit down like a beautiful squat as this is going to lock your hips into an anterior tilt which is what you want with a body weight squat. So I want you to do exactly the opposite to a beautiful body weight squat or a back squat. So for the purpose of correcting your anterior pelvic tilt we will be tucking our tailbone back and flattening our backs to create posterior hip tilt and decompression in the lower back. I want you to sit down as deep as you can and lean back so you're the weight of your body and your upper body will be pulling in opposite directions. Hold this position for about 1 to 3 minutes. If you want to create more mobility in your lower back hips and heels, just sway back side to side. This is a great way to relieve back pain and get some movement in your joints again.

So a great compound exercise that's going to target a lot, pretty much all the muscles that are associated with knee pain is the squat. Me personally, I think the squat is the premier exercise for building overall lower body health. What I'm going to do first is just use a sturdy chair one without wheels and let's slide to the edge of it like this. And then from there, let's just stand up.

Similarly, with a lunge, as you lunge forward onto your foot, that knee should be right in line with your toe. If it buckles to the inside, that is an indication that we have some work to do on that lateral hip muscle. Now, of course, I'm curious to hear your results. If you try to any of these tests, Leave me a comment down below. Let me know how they turned out for you. Now, if you do have knee pain and you try these tests and you find out that your hips are weak, obviously, when you need to work on strengthening those hips. What I'd like to do now is run you through a progression of four exercises that are going to help to improve that gluteus medius strength or that hip abductor strength and hopefully help your knee to feel better. Again, there are four exercises I wanna start with easiest and then work up to the hardest. So hopefully we find a solution it's going to be perfect for you. Exercise number one, may seem simple at first glance, but don't count it out. It's actually pretty tough, especially if you're weak in those hip abductors. Let's do some sideline hip abduction. Lay down on your uningered side. That means your injured knee is going to be up towards the",

So what happens is the band pulls the distal part of the tibia back, which is the furthest part of your shin bone away from you. As you lean forward with the tension, it creates this dorsic flexion against your foot and your ankle and this creates ankle mobilization in dorsic flexion, which is what you need when you do squats. What's even more important is to start off back and forth and then lean side to the side. Try to hold at the point of stretchers for about one or two seconds, and then move to another point. Now this is a deep squat mobilization technique. Since you're in this position in a squat position, it's a pretty good idea to put yourself in this position and stretch it out. You're always trying to hold this position for about 30 seconds at first, then try to get to one minute and at the end maybe in five minutes. You might feel some pain in tingling, stop at that point and then relax and try to get later on. Now if this is too easy for you, lean side to side in different angles and hold that position for about 10 seconds and then move to another angle. What's amazing is that my grandma can see in this position and she does most of her housework in this position as well and she has no low",

So you, again, I want to surgery. Now, let's say you tore your ACL or PCL along with the MCL. Well, in that case, they're recommending that you do have the MCL. I mean, the ACL repaired, but you still leave the MCL alone because they make where money I need. Yeah, right. Now, the ACL does provide some of that stability that the MCL does. Right. So it needs to be repaired. Otherwise, There's going to be too much stress on the MCL guys. Two out of the four legaments gone. Yeah, it's too much. It's just too much. So you're going to want to go ahead and have that repaired. Now, what about an MCL? All right, the ACL. So that's the big one that happens quite often. By the way, I got numbers on the way this spread. 150,000 new ACL tears a year.",

I recently had an ACL injury, probably the most devastating injury I've had and you know the most difficult and having that injury kind of broke me down and it made me have to start at zero again. Females are eight times more likely to sustain an ACL injury compared to males. To help prevent these ACL injuries from happening, there are things you can do. We're going to demonstrate today. Seven exercises that you can perform to stay on the field. Exercise number one, your basic squat. Ally is going to drop back like she's sitting in a chair. Knees do not come forward. Hip, straw, back, head stays up. Drive up through the heels. And the first movement was not to bend at the knees, but actually drop the hips back. Head and shoulders come forward. and she dries back up through the heels. Exercise number two, jump squat, knees hip, foot stays aligned. She's gonna generate upper body power, load up. She's gonna jump up, soft landing. Drops back on the heels into a seated position. Exercise number three, the lateral bound. Same technique as a squat. Everything stays aligned. She's gonna load up, drive through the hip. She's going to jump to the other side, lateral hop there, good deceleration on the landing, very soft landing.",

This is going to help you anchor down your upper body and allow you back to decompress as you lean back and allow your weight to stretch out your lumbar rectus. With this stretch I don't want you to just sit down like a beautiful squat as this is going to lock your hips into an anterior tilt which is what you want with a body weight squat. So I want you to do exactly the opposite to a beautiful body weight squat or a back squat. So for the purpose of correcting your anterior pelvic tilt we will be tucking our tailbone back and flattening our backs to create posterior hip tilt and decompression in the lower back. I want you to sit down as deep as you can and lean back so you're the weight of your body and your upper body will be pulling in opposite directions. Hold this position for about 1 to 3 minutes. If you want to create more mobility in your lower back hips and heels, just sway back side to side. This is a great way to relieve back pain and get some movement in your joints again.

So as you're seeing it slowly bend it, and our goals for ACL reconstruction are in week one, you want to get about 30 degrees, right about what you've gotten. The purpose of going super slow with our program is realizing that the graph is under a lot of biological chaos in the first couple of weeks. And what we see is that if you move it very aggressively in the first few weeks, then you may be changing the environment and you may be altering the biology of how the healing occurs. We don't really know this. But I've found that if you go a little slower, you'll lot of biology to work. And if you don't lose your motion by this program as well too, So you're supposed to be getting 30 degrees in the first week, 60 degrees by week two, and",

So if you find that all of these are too easy, try to do an alternating motion. So go back into that first position, and then go back like this. And I tell you what, this takes a lot of coordination into that knee, but it's going to help build strength in there and just get all of those muscles working together to hopefully ward off future instances of knee pain. So a great compound exercise that's going to target a lot, pretty much all the muscles that are associated with knee pain is the squat. Me personally, I think the squat is the premier exercise for building overall lower body health. What I'm going to do first is just use a sturdy chair one without wheels and let's slide to the edge of it like this. And then from there, let's just stand up. I'm going to position my feet to be shoulder width apart and my toes are going to be slightly angled out about 10 degrees. This will help take a little bit off in these themselves. Let's make sure the low back has very good upright posture. Let's engage the core a little bit.

Similarly, with a lunge, as you lunge forward onto your foot, that knee should be right in line with your toe. If it buckles to the inside, that is an indication that we have some work to do on that lateral hip muscle. Now, of course, I'm curious to hear your results. If you try to any of these tests, Leave me a comment down below. Let me know how they turned out for you. Now, if you do have knee pain and you try these tests and you find out that your hips are weak, obviously, when you need to work on strengthening those hips. What I'd like to do now is run you through a progression of four exercises that are going to help to improve that gluteus medius strength or that hip abductor strength and hopefully help your knee to feel better. Again, there are four exercises I wanna start with easiest and then work up to the hardest. So hopefully we find a solution it's going to be perfect for you. Exercise number one, may seem simple at first glance, but don't count it out. It's actually pretty tough, especially if you're weak in those hip abductors. Let's do some sideline hip abduction. Lay down on your uningered side. That means your injured knee is going to be up towards the",

So what happens is the band pulls the distal part of the tibia back, which is the furthest part of your shin bone away from you. As you lean forward with the tension, it creates this dorsic flexion against your foot and your ankle and this creates ankle mobilization in dorsic flexion, which is what you need when you do squats. What's even more important is to start off back and forth and then lean side to the side. Try to hold at the point of stretchers for about one or two seconds, and then move to another point. Now this is a deep squat mobilization technique. Since you're in this position in a squat position, it's a pretty good idea to put yourself in this position and stretch it out. You're always trying to hold this position for about 30 seconds at first, then try to get to one minute and at the end maybe in five minutes. You might feel some pain in tingling, stop at that point and then relax and try to get later on. Now if this is too easy for you, lean side to side in different angles and hold that position for about 10 seconds and then move to another angle.

I recently had an ACL injury, probably the most devastating injury I've had and you know the most difficult and having that injury kind of broke me down and it made me have to start at zero again. Females are eight times more likely to sustain an ACL injury compared to males. To help prevent these ACL injuries from happening, there are things you can do. We're going to demonstrate today. Seven exercises that you can perform to stay on the field. Exercise number one, your basic squat. Ally is going to drop back like she's sitting in a chair. Knees do not come forward. Hip, straw, back, head stays up. Drive up through the heels. And the first movement was not to bend at the knees, but actually drop the hips back. Head and shoulders come forward. and she dries back up through the heels. Exercise number two, jump squat, knees hip, foot stays aligned. She's gonna generate upper body power, load up. She's gonna jump up, soft landing. Drops back on the heels into a seated position. Exercise number three, the lateral bound. Same technique as a squat. Everything stays aligned. She's gonna load up, drive through the hip. She's going to jump to the other side, lateral hop there, good deceleration on the landing, very soft landing.",

We're going to talk about this later as you lose your proprioception. You lose the ability to tell where the knee has at its space and makes you more vulnerable to re-engineering it again. your balance is going to be off. You might fall down, you wouldn't expect it. So you, again, I want to surgery. Now, let's say you tore your ACL or PCL along with the MCL. Well, in that case, they're recommending that you do have the MCL. I mean, the ACL repaired, but you still leave the MCL alone because they make where money I need. Yeah, right. Now, the ACL does provide some of that stability that the MCL does. Right. So it needs to be repaired. Otherwise, There's going to be too much stress on the MCL guys. Two out of the four legaments gone. Yeah, it's too much. It's just too much. So you're going to want to go ahead and have that repaired. Now, what about an MCL? All right, the ACL. So that's the big one that happens quite often. By the way, I got numbers on the way this spread. 150,000 new ACL tears a year.",

Maybe she's not happy, nobody's happy. All right, that's the ACL, the MCL is on the inside of the knee, and that goes from here that this bone to that alone, which is from the femoral to the tibia.

The ACL and the PCL actually curse Croats, they're right next, they're like little buddies. There's the lateral collateral ligament, but that one usually doesn't get injured as much. Not as much. It's just on the other side of the knee. It's right under the skin. You can feel that as well as the MSL or the fingers under the skin kind of.

Sure. And start doing single leg squats. We're going to go. We're going to really dance people. Show a given demonstration of how the wrong way to do it, okay. So let's say with both even, a lot of people do this. They land even when they're jumping, they land like this. They need to come together. They come for, I see a lot of ladies all time even in volleyball, they go like this. And they want to go like this. So it's really important, again, that's going to stop that knee from coming in. Also you're going to be less likely to get injured. Right. So it is, statistically, I think it's a female basketball players in high school have the highest rate of ACL injuries, which can be related to this land. Yep. Now, you were going to show that the squat with the band on? Oh, yeah. I mean, so yep, you can get the band on like this. And then, just hold out, and if you wanted to do a, you know, this is for the more advanced. Sure, now you're going to double work out. Right. And I'm trying to get the squat in your work.

And when you're done with that, what you're going to find is instead of just kicking that out, which again, you don't want to do. In this position, the muscles of the quad are attached to the front of the tibia, and they will actually tug on the ACL if you do that. So you want to use this assisted device right here, your leg, behind the ankle, and gradually bring that exactly perfect.

          "text": "So what is a tibial plateau fracture? A fracture or a break in the upper part of the shin bone that tibia may be the result of a low impact injury such as a fall or from a high impact injury such as a motor vehicle accident. Proper identification and management of these injuries will help to restore limb function such as strength, motion and stability and reduce the overall risks of arthritis. The bone comprising the tibial plateau is cancelous or crunchy, as opposed to the thicker cortical bone of tibial shaft, whether the injury is treated with surgery or without, both the bony injury or the fracture, and any soft tissue injuries must be treated together. Fractures that involve the upper fourth of the lower leg or tibia may or may not involve the knee joint. Fractures that enter the knee joint may render the joint imperfect and the joint surface irregular. Additionally, these fractures may result in improper limelightment, either of these factors may contribute to excessive joint wear, which can cause arthritis, instability, and loss of motion. Where a fracture is located within the knee and how much it is displaced is referred to as its pattern. The pattern of a fracture is determined by the force of the injury, in addition to how and where that force is applied to the limb. There are several symptoms of a tibial plateau fracture, pain when bearing weight, tenderness and swelling around the knee, resulting in the limitation of leg bending, deformity around the",

When you test for the medioclateral ligament, you have the patient's knee at zero degrees of flexion full extension, and you initially put a valgustress arm so you try to open them up that way. And if they have instability that is they open up here or if that reproduces their pain and they give you a history which is consistent with medioclateral ligament here, then you've made your diagnosis. What I then will do is I'll open them up to about 30 degrees of flexion and repeat the examination with valgus stress and you're looking for the same thing there. Now I'll flip the model over and show how one them tries to assess the lateral clad or ligament demonstrated here at zero degrees of flexion. You try to open them up and then 30 degrees of flexion try to open them up, rotate out. Okay, the anterior crucial ligament is assessed using four different techniques. There's the anterior deure technique. The anterior deure technique is simple to do, it's not as sensitive, but it's pre-specific. So the patients have a history consistent with anterior crucial ligament injury. They were weight-bearing and they twisted and they felt something pop. If they have a positive anterior deure test, which is manifest as increased laxity on the injured side compared to the uninsured side, then they have an anterior crucial ligament tear. However, if",

And if you try to make a contraction, you're going to see that it's not going to be working very well because it's been turned off. So you want to turn it back on because getting this muscle turned on is going to be very important for your recovery. So what you do is use a biocube back method by contracting one side and trying to contract the other one at the same time. By doing both of them at the same time contract release contract release. Again, 5 to 10 minutes 2 to 3 times a day. By doing that, I'll also help to kind of get that engaged. All right. So that's exercise number 2. Exercise number 3 is a little bit tricky. And to understand exercise number 3, we have to realize that when you put an ACL in, and you contract this muscle here, then you're going to compress this tibia bone in the right way. You're going to compress it. that if the leg is hanging over the table and you try to straight match your leg, then the muscle forces of that quad muscle here are going to actually pull on",

If it buckles to the inside, that is an indication that we have some work to do on that lateral hip muscle. Now, of course, I'm curious to hear your results. If you try to any of these tests, Leave me a comment down below. Let me know how they turned out for you. Now, if you do have knee pain and you try these tests and you find out that your hips are weak, obviously, when you need to work on strengthening those hips. What I'd like to do now is run you through a progression of four exercises that are going to help to improve that gluteus medius strength or that hip abductor strength and hopefully help your knee to feel better. Again, there are four exercises I wanna start with easiest and then work up to the hardest. So hopefully we find a solution it's going to be perfect for you. Exercise number one, may seem simple at first glance, but don't count it out. It's actually pretty tough, especially if you're weak in those hip abductors. Let's do some sideline hip abduction.

We're going to talk about this later as you lose your proprioception. You lose the ability to tell where the knee has at its space and makes you more vulnerable to re-engineering it again. your balance is going to be off. You might fall down, you wouldn't expect it. So you, again, I want to surgery. Now, let's say you tore your ACL or PCL along with the MCL. Well, in that case, they're recommending that you do have the MCL. I mean, the ACL repaired, but you still leave the MCL alone because they make where money I need. Yeah, right. Now, the ACL does provide some of that stability that the MCL does. Right. So it needs to be repaired. Otherwise, There's going to be too much stress on the MCL guys. Two out of the four legaments gone. Yeah, it's too much. It's just too much. So you're going to want to go ahead and have that repaired. Now, what about an MCL? All right, the ACL. So that's the big one that happens quite often. By the way, I got numbers on the way this spread. 150,000 new ACL tears a year.",

That's not good so we don't want that. Okay, so the third exercise in the big three is going to be getting the knee bent because ultimately you're going to want that at some point in time. Okay, so what we do here is rather than this grabbing the knee up which will pull on the ACL a bit as well too, You don't learn how to bring the opposite leg under, under, under the ankle. What you want to do is not do what you're just about to do. It's our ACL sitting right here. And so what you don't want to do is put any forces behind the leg here.

I recently had an ACL injury, probably the most devastating injury I've had and you know the most difficult and having that injury kind of broke me down and it made me have to start at zero again. Females are eight times more likely to sustain an ACL injury compared to males. To help prevent these ACL injuries from happening, there are things you can do. We're going to demonstrate today. Seven exercises that you can perform to stay on the field. Exercise number one, your basic squat. Ally is going to drop back like she's sitting in a chair. Knees do not come forward. Hip, straw, back, head stays up. Drive up through the heels. And the first movement was not to bend at the knees, but actually drop the hips back. Head and shoulders come forward. and she dries back up through the heels. Exercise number two, jump squat, knees hip, foot stays aligned. She's gonna generate upper body power, load up. She's gonna jump up, soft landing. Drops back on the heels into a seated position. Exercise number three, the lateral bound. Same technique as a squat. Everything stays aligned. She's gonna load up, drive through the hip. She's going to jump to the other side, lateral hop there, good deceleration on the landing, very soft landing.",

And when you're done with that, what you're going to find is instead of just kicking that out, which again, you don't want to do. In this position, the muscles of the quad are attached to the front of the tibia, and they will actually tug on the ACL if you do that. So you want to use this assisted device right here, your leg, behind the ankle, and gradually bring that exactly perfect.

Because again, you can see that's that flexor pattern. So you could stay on these two activities for days. If every time you go to stand up, it goes right back into that extensor pattern, then I would go back to this. Because the next progression we're going to do is a little mini set to stand, so I'm not going to extend my knees or my hips all the way, because I don't want to go into that extensor pattern. So I'm going to stay really flexed. I have the involved leg on this wedge. And that's helpful if your foot is severely inverted. This will help to prevent that inversion.

This exercise is going to help improve lower back pain, prevent lower back injuries and reduce your anterior hip tilt. Do about 15 to 20 repetitions for three to four sets. In 2015, the Journal of Physical Therapy Science published a paper on the clinical applications of strengthening the muscles of the cloutier's groups against doing lumber segmental stabilization exercises. The results showed that there was a greater decrease in lower back pain and an increase in lumber muscles strength and balance ability in the cloutier's groups, compared to the lumber stability exercise group. This is why it decides so much on doing glute strengthening exercises with lower back exercises to prevent lower back pain, strengthening the hips and lower back and prevent injuries in the future. Reverse ab curls. A common mistake with this exercise is starting your back in the arched position. So please flatten your back and rotate your hips back in a posterior tilt position by tucking your tailbone back. Start by lifting up your knees in a bent position, whilst focusing, flattening your back against the ground and in a posterior tilt position slowly and in a controlled manner, lower your feet down to the ground and back up again. Do about 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. If you start this exercise in an anterior pelvic tilt position, you will encourage the activation of the hip flexor muscles instead of the lower",

Proper knife safety will help prevent accidental cuts. Knives should be used with respect and care, and for their intended purpose, always cut away from your body and re-sheath or close your knife when not in use. Once hands and fingers are closest to the blade when using a knife, the majority of knife injuries occur here. Knife injuries come in two forms, cuts and lacerations or punctures. Lacerations are long tears in the skin and are usually shallow, whereas punctures have a small entry point and can disguise a deep wound. If you do cut yourself, remain calm and take these steps to treat your injury. The first thing you want to do is stop the bleeding. Apply direct and constant pressure to the wound for 15 minutes. Use gauze, a clean cloth, or your hand as a last resort. You can also elevate the wound above your heart to help stop the bleeding. To clean the wound, use clean water and mild soap to wash out any dirt and bacteria. Lastly seal the wound. Apply antibiotic ointment if available, and use a sterile bandage and secured with tape. Now not all knife injuries are minor, so how do you know if it's a serious injury? Deep cuts or puncture wounds to vital areas of the body, such as the head, face, throat, or",

      "answer": "To set up for preventing ACL injuries, it\u2019s crucial to understand the mechanics involved in the knee joint and the role of the quadriceps muscle. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide based on the provided evidence:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Ensure the leg is properly positioned. When setting up for an ACL graft, avoid having the leg hanging over the table. This position can lead to improper muscle forces acting on the knee.\n\n2. **Muscle Activation**: Focus on contracting the quadriceps muscle. This contraction is essential as it helps to compress the tibia bone appropriately. Proper muscle engagement ensures that the forces are directed correctly, minimizing stress on the ACL graft.\n\n3. **Avoiding Strain**: Be cautious when straightening the leg. If the leg is not supported correctly, attempting to straighten it can lead to excessive pulling on the ACL graft due to the muscle forces from the quadriceps. This can jeopardize the integrity of the graft.\n\n4. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the alignment and muscle engagement throughout the setup to ensure safety and effectiveness.\n\nBy following these steps, you can help prevent ACL injuries during rehabilitation or post-surgery activities [Video 1: wM8BZeneF4c, Time:",

Females are eight times more likely to sustain an ACL injury compared to males. To help prevent these ACL injuries from happening, there are things you can do. We're going to demonstrate today. Seven exercises that you can perform to stay on the field. Exercise number one, your basic squat. Ally is going to drop back like she's sitting in a chair. Knees do not come forward. Hip, straw, back, head stays up. Drive up through the heels. And the first movement was not to bend at the knees, but actually drop the hips back. Head and shoulders come forward. and she dries back up through the heels. Exercise number two, jump squat, knees hip, foot stays aligned. She's gonna generate upper body power, load up. She's gonna jump up, soft landing. Drops back on the heels into a seated position. Exercise number three, the lateral bound. Same technique as a squat. Everything stays aligned. She's gonna load up, drive through the hip. She's going to jump to the other side, lateral hop there, good deceleration on the landing, very soft landing.",

Go through the basic comfortable zone. Don't stretch it too much and back. If you find it's getting easier you can apply slide pressure on the heel and do the same movement for 3 sets of 8 to and basically 12 repetition. Now, again, in some cases you might say about what can we do this immediately after my injury that's still to be fine. If you find any of the exercises aggravating your pain too much in the hamstring, you don't want to necessarily do that so often. Maybe give it a try for other exercise and slowly back to that routine and that is specifically exercise after a few days. Alright guys, we're going to move on to prone hamstring curls which is if you're body weight and in time you can actually use the ankle and weight coughs. I'm going to show you both the option and you can give it a try. You're gonna roll it on on the tummy and you are going to like literally actively kill that hamstring.

You might feel it more in your hips. You might feel it more at your knee, but it doesn't matter because that hamstring is all the way up in your hip down, pass your knee.

This will create a stretch on the outer portion of your hamstring. Your hamstrings tend to be shortened when you're in a sitting position for long periods of time. Since bending your knee is one of the main actions of your hamstrings. To stretch the middle portion of your hamstrings, just slump your body over your straight leg while facing your foot.

Because as long as you feel a slight stretch, That's enough to create some change.

This is a great way you can still do the P&F stretches without getting onto the floor, especially if you have trouble getting up and down from the floor. Just find a stool or chair that you can place your heel on it while keeping your leg straight and your knee extended. To really target the hamstring muscles, please anteriorly tilt your hips by rotating your hips forward. This places your hamstrings in a elongated position by pulling the hamstrings into a pre-stretched position. Now lean your body forward without hunching your back, by holding up your chest as much as possible. This will help target the hamstrings a lot better. I like to gently rest my hands slightly above my knee to promote my leg to stay in a straight position and my knee in extension. After holding the stretch for about 20-30 seconds at approximately 50-60% capacity, I want you to press your heel back onto the chair or bench for about 6-8 seconds and apply about 30-40% force against the chair or bench with your heel. Once 6-8 seconds is over, you can go back to the point of stretch and hold it again for about 20-30 seconds at about 50-60% capacity of stretch. When you are doing this stretch, please keep your shoulders square on, whilst facing the leg that you're stretching.

And if you don't lose your motion by this program as well too, So you're supposed to be getting 30 degrees in the first week, 60 degrees by week two, and between weeks three and four, you want to slowly get up to 90 degrees. You're almost at the beginning of week two. So you can slowly, gradually bring that to 60. So again, active flexion is OK. As you're bending it, active bending is OK. Active bending is OK. Because that's actually pulling the leg backwards in this protective of the ACL. And when you're done with that, what you're going to find is instead of just kicking that out, which again, you don't want to do. In this position, the muscles of the quad are attached to the front of the tibia, and they will actually tug on the ACL if you do that. So you want to use this assisted device right here, your leg, behind the ankle, and gradually bring that exactly perfect. And then when you're done with that, so you do that again, 5 to 10 minutes, 2, 3 times a day, that's that third part of the big three. Come down to get one more time, nice and easy, nice and easy, nice and easy, nice and easy, nice and slow, you don't have to do",

I recently had an ACL injury, probably the most devastating injury I've had and you know the most difficult and having that injury kind of broke me down and it made me have to start at zero again. Females are eight times more likely to sustain an ACL injury compared to males. To help prevent these ACL injuries from happening, there are things you can do. We're going to demonstrate today. Seven exercises that you can perform to stay on the field. Exercise number one, your basic squat. Ally is going to drop back like she's sitting in a chair. Knees do not come forward. Hip, straw, back, head stays up. Drive up through the heels. And the first movement was not to bend at the knees, but actually drop the hips back. Head and shoulders come forward. and she dries back up through the heels. Exercise number two, jump squat, knees hip, foot stays aligned. She's gonna generate upper body power, load up. She's gonna jump up, soft landing. Drops back on the heels into a seated position. Exercise number three, the lateral bound. Same technique as a squat. Everything stays aligned. She's gonna load up, drive through the hip. She's going to jump to the other side, lateral hop there, good deceleration on the landing, very soft landing.",

Ensure your core is engaged, with your tummy tight and spine flat to maintain proper alignment.\n\n2. **Walk Out**: Slowly walk out with the physioball. As you do this, keep your foot, knee, and hip aligned. This alignment is crucial to prevent undue stress on the knee joint, which can contribute to ACL injuries [Video 1: xWBSf4BfKRk, Time: 03:17-03:21].\n\n3. **Control Movement**: As you extend one hip, do so with control, then lower it down. Repeat this for the opposite side, ensuring that each movement is deliberate and controlled to maintain stability.\n\n4. **Maintain Core Engagement**: Throughout the exercise, keep your core engaged to support your spine and pelvis, which will help in maintaining balance and reducing the risk of injury.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: Avoid rushing through the movements to prevent loss of control, which could lead to improper alignment and increase the risk of injury.\n\nBy following these",

I mean, the ACL repaired, but you still leave the MCL alone because they make where money I need. Yeah, right. Now, the ACL does provide some of that stability that the MCL does. Right. So it needs to be repaired. Otherwise, There's going to be too much stress on the MCL guys. Two out of the four legaments gone. Yeah, it's too much. It's just too much. So you're going to want to go ahead and have that repaired. Now, what about an MCL? All right, the ACL. So that's the big one that happens quite often.

I recently had an ACL injury, probably the most devastating injury I've had and you know the most difficult and having that injury kind of broke me down and it made me have to start at zero again. Females are eight times more likely to sustain an ACL injury compared to males. To help prevent these ACL injuries from happening, there are things you can do. We're going to demonstrate today. Seven exercises that you can perform to stay on the field. Exercise number one, your basic squat. Ally is going to drop back like she's sitting in a chair. Knees do not come forward. Hip, straw, back, head stays up. Drive up through the heels. And the first movement was not to bend at the knees, but actually drop the hips back. Head and shoulders come forward. and she dries back up through the heels. Exercise number two, jump squat, knees hip, foot stays aligned. She's gonna generate upper body power, load up. She's gonna jump up, soft landing. Drops back on the heels into a seated position. Exercise number three, the lateral bound. Same technique as a squat. Everything stays aligned. She's gonna load up, drive through the hip. She's going to jump to the other side, lateral hop there, good deceleration on the landing, very soft landing.",

You're almost at the beginning of week two. So you can slowly, gradually bring that to 60. So again, active flexion is OK. As you're bending it, active bending is OK. Active bending is OK. Because that's actually pulling the leg backwards in this protective of the ACL. And when you're done with that, what you're going to find is instead of just kicking that out, which again, you don't want to do. In this position, the muscles of the quad are attached to the front of the tibia, and they will actually tug on the ACL if you do that. So you want to use this assisted device right here, your leg, behind the ankle, and gradually bring that exactly perfect. And then when you're done with that, so you do that again, 5 to 10 minutes, 2, 3 times a day, that's that third part of the big three.

The weight bearing restrictions are different for everybody. In your case, they're going to be full weight bearing. Weight bearing restrictions are different for everybody. So the three exercises we do, the first one is really maintaining the knee and extension. So you want to make sure that you have good knee extension and all this is said and done. So one of the purposes of having the brace is to make sure this knee is straight. So what you're going to do by five to ten minutes, two to three times a day is you're going to work on making sure that the back of the knee can actually touch the table. Okay, it's like we're doing right here. So you're going to slowly let the knee hang backwards, let the back of the knee touch the table and make sure that this is straight. Okay, you've got that already and the great thing about having the brace is with the brace So you usually get that already. That's number one. Number two is getting an muscle contraction. You want to sit up here just for a second? And what we typically will do is we'll use the other side as a template. So you're going to put your right hand on your right. That's kind of your lift guy.

So now we're going to go in and we're going to show you the two style deadlift that we use which is the RDL and the sumo style deadlift and why we do them. So before an athlete even attempts any style deadlift, whether it be sumo or some regular deadlift on the floor with your legs a little bit closer stance, we always start with the RDL. The RDLs are staple foundational exercise to develop the glutes, develop the low back and get them in the proper position so that that when they go down to deadlift they can keep that angle and not look like this and around their back out. So that's why the RDL is so important to develop and it's much easier to develop than the deadlift and it's going to apply and that's why most of the time we're going to squat and we're going to RDL because the RDL is a very practical tool for building sprint speed and explosive power because it takes all the legs out of the equation and it allows you to just simply focus on the glutes and the hamstrings in order to develop that the posterior chain to make the athlete explosive. So for an RDL, we use a box and this really forces the athlete to push their glutes back so that they can activate their glutes. And I want them an inch forward. So right now, he goes",

I do them myself and prescribe these exercises for my patients, and I find that the ones that do learn and attain the strength of a time seem to have less or no back pain at all in the long run. If you prefer to do the isometric holds but would like to challenge yourself a little bit further, you can buy drawings, more squares with either your fist or foot. This will create movement in the spine that the collar will need to resist and work against to build costability and control. This will be replicating external forces acting on you whilst you are bending over or trying to lift yourself or performing a lift in the gym. So the strength that you attain for these exercises are quite functional from daily activities and sport. Depending on how fast you draw the squares, you can try to draw three to five squares on both sides and do three sets on both sides with one minute break if you need to. Remember, you don't have to draw the squares clockwise. You can also draw the squares anticlockwise. Obviously, working your weaknesses so you can prevent the injury and lower back pain. So this is the exercise something I've written for the video. Just pick two to three exercises you're comfortable with and do it for about three to five weeks.

I'll leave a link in the description box below on where to get a Firm Rowling. First, you would need a Firm Rowling and if you have a high pain tolerance you can use a PVC pipe. Place it on the ground and allow your thigh to lay on top of it where your main muscle belly is. Now roll up and down the thigh in a nice and slow controlled manner. Try to work all the way from the end of the quadriceps just above your kneecap and to the top of the muscles where it attaches just below the hip bone. Remember the quadriceps are on the inner and outer parts of your thighs. So I want you to roll over these parts as well. Just roll on 8th thigh for about 1-2-3 minutes or you can stop when you notice the thigh is no longer tender and move on to the next thigh. However with this technique I don't want you to force yourself to feel pain as it can cause bruising and injury. Hip flexor release with the lacrosse ball. I'll leave a link in the description box below on a way to get a massage ball. Just place the lacrosse ball in front of your hip just off the hip bone to watch abdomen. This is where the hip flexo",

This is a teaching video to help those of you who are interested in care of the head and neck injured athlete on the field and transport off the field to the nearest hospital facility. It's extremely important that we manage these people carefully so that we do not worsen their injuries in any way, particularly if they have a neurological deficit. This video will demonstrate the technique of immobilization, how to handle a face mask and remove it carefully, leaving the helmet and chin strapped in place, and the carefully log rolling the patient onto a back board, immobilizing them and they're carefully transporting them to the nearest hospital. These injuries occur with usually contact on the top of the head and an axial neck injury resulting sometimes unconsciousness and or neck injury. Breathing must be controlled and that's why we have to remove the face mask. We should have access to the airway and then a mobilization of the neck if it is a neck injury so that the injury is not worsened any further. Our concern of course with head injuries that we always have to assume there is an associated neck injury. So with that, we'll pass this on to the trainers and the Greenville system to teach us how to manage these specifically on the field of play. The log roll technique is",

However, please be mindful there are anatomical structures that you need to be avoiding or else you'll be injuring the femoral artery, the femoral vein and the femoral nerve in this area. If you still feel like this technique's not working for you, try rolling up and down the muscle belly instead. Do this for about 20 strokes, two to three times on each hip flexor. Lunge hip flexor stretch, going to a kneeling lunge position and try to have all your knee joints starting out in a squared bent position. I like to have something soft under the knee to support my knee, especially if I'm working on a hard floor like a forward towel. But in this case, I'm on a foam floor so I won't be using a soft towel to save my knees from hurting. Now to in the center of this stretch to fix anterior hip tilt, don't stretch your hips with the anterior hip tilt position, where your hips are rotated forward. So instead, be mindful of the positioning of your hips and rotate your hips back in a posterior tilt position, a bit like tucking your tailbone backwards. This will promote posterior hip tilt and combat the opposing position. The anterior hip tilt hold this stretch for about 30 seconds on each side and alternating four to five times on each side. The hip flexor stretch to accentuate this stretch for the hip flex are more. Just raise your arm above your head, bend your body over",

And I recommend you do this one about 15 reps, 2 to 3 sets every other day. The next exercise we're going to do is call the prone tease or there's many other names to it. Its main purpose is to activate those lower trapezius muscles that get weak and underactive on most people who have rounded shoulders posture. So you can do this one on the floor or on a bench. I'm doing it on a bench here, okay, and I'm just going to place my arms on my sides. And from here, what all I'm going to do is I'm going to externally rotate my thumbs, okay, and then I'm going to go up into a T position, okay, and then bring it down, okay, and again. This is deceivingly harder than what it seems like. It's one of the hardest exercises And you want to pinch your shoulder blades together, okay? That's what's important for this one.

And then she rolls kind of to that right side, put your hands back behind you, there it is. And then we can roll up and down over the top of that piriformis muscle that way. Again, a popular popular, a common place to get muscle knots is in the top of the hip, the top of that glute. This is a great way that you can mobilize and kind of get to those muscle knots in those areas. Just like that. So don't foam roll your lower back, but definitely foam roll your upper glute and your piriformis. Finally, the last thing that I like is going to be one of these stericanes. Now, again, I mentioned to you earlier that I did another video that was all about muscle knots in the neck and upper back. We kind of introduce the Therricane in that spot. It's a great way that you can just kind of apply that pressure to that spot in your back. But then with this, you can also do it. So you can turn it this way. And then you can do it with your lower back as well. And so she's going to just grab both handles on that Therricane and find the spot that she wants to massage and mobilize in there. So a pressure point. So then as soon as she finds that trigger",

So with that, we'll pass this on to the trainers and the Greenville system to teach us how to manage these specifically on the field of play. The log roll technique is appropriate if the athlete is found in a prone position and not breathing. Position the athletes arm to the side of the athlete before tempting to log roll. The first medical personnel on the scene is the leader. This person should issue all commands. You hear me? You okay? No. There's no response. I want you to go get me some help, call 911. The leader should take control of the injured person's head. The leader holds the head with both hands stabilizing it by holding firmly and allowing no motion. We're going to have to roll him, supine, I'm going to need one person on the shoulders, I want it to hips and want it to feet. Direct all rescuers to reach across the injured person and grab a hold of the upper arm and shoulder, the pelvis and the legs. Make sure to grab the body part and not pull on the article of clothing. Roll the interperson towards you upon the leader's call. Roll on three. Roll the person down on the leader's call, down on three, one, two, three. If a spawn board is available, log roll the",

This will open and close the vertebrae, allowing nutrients to flow in and out of the discs. This will help reduce stiffness, inflammation and repair if there is an injury. That's why the side plank raises a very effective to improve spinal health and reduce pain and stiffness in the lower back. Try the mountain, cat towels, go on all falls with your hands and knees spaced out or slightly wider than your shoulder width and your knees are about 90 degrees. Then round your back and flex all segments in your spine all the way up and posteriorly rotate your hips back tucking your hips backwards, squeezing the abdominal muscles and chest muscles to make yourself look like an angry cat. This will cause the spine to flex. To do a cow position, anteriorly rotate your hips, drop your stomach towards the floor squeeze your shoulder blades together, this works thin your upper back and lower back slightly. Take in a deep long breath during a cal position and exhale in a long and slow manner in the cal position. Do 10 repetitions for 3 to 4 sets and if you really need to have one minute break between the sets. This exercise will help you when you have extreme or acute lower back pain, as it helps mobilize the spine and back in a safe manner. The vertebral discs in",

This is a teaching video to help those of you who are interested in care of the head and neck injured athlete on the field and transport off the field to the nearest hospital facility. It's extremely important that we manage these people carefully so that we do not worsen their injuries in any way, particularly if they have a neurological deficit. This video will demonstrate the technique of immobilization, how to handle a face mask and remove it carefully, leaving the helmet and chin strapped in place, and the carefully log rolling the patient onto a back board, immobilizing them and they're carefully transporting them to the nearest hospital. These injuries occur with usually contact on the top of the head and an axial neck injury resulting sometimes unconsciousness and or neck injury. Breathing must be controlled and that's why we have to remove the face mask. We should have access to the airway and then a mobilization of the neck if it is a neck injury so that the injury is not worsened any further. Our concern of course with head injuries that we always have to assume there is an associated neck injury. So with that, we'll pass this on to the trainers and the Greenville system to teach us how to manage these specifically on the field of play. The log roll technique is",

I'll leave a link in the description box below on where to get a Firm Rowling. First, you would need a Firm Rowling and if you have a high pain tolerance you can use a PVC pipe. Place it on the ground and allow your thigh to lay on top of it where your main muscle belly is. Now roll up and down the thigh in a nice and slow controlled manner. Try to work all the way from the end of the quadriceps just above your kneecap and to the top of the muscles where it attaches just below the hip bone. Remember the quadriceps are on the inner and outer parts of your thighs. So I want you to roll over these parts as well. Just roll on 8th thigh for about 1-2-3 minutes or you can stop when you notice the thigh is no longer tender and move on to the next thigh. However with this technique I don't want you to force yourself to feel pain as it can cause bruising and injury. Hip flexor release with the lacrosse ball. I'll leave a link in the description box below on a way to get a massage ball. Just place the lacrosse ball in front of your hip just off the hip bone to watch abdomen. This is where the hip flexo",

This is a teaching video to help those of you who are interested in care of the head and neck injured athlete on the field and transport off the field to the nearest hospital facility. It's extremely important that we manage these people carefully so that we do not worsen their injuries in any way, particularly if they have a neurological deficit. This video will demonstrate the technique of immobilization, how to handle a face mask and remove it carefully, leaving the helmet and chin strapped in place, and the carefully log rolling the patient onto a back board, immobilizing them and they're carefully transporting them to the nearest hospital. These injuries occur with usually contact on the top of the head and an axial neck injury resulting sometimes unconsciousness and or neck injury. Breathing must be controlled and that's why we have to remove the face mask. We should have access to the airway and then a mobilization of the neck if it is a neck injury so that the injury is not worsened any further. Our concern of course with head injuries that we always have to assume there is an associated neck injury. So with that, we'll pass this on to the trainers and the Greenville system to teach us how to manage these specifically on the field of play. The log roll technique is",

It also allows them to administer pre-hospital care without removing the helmet. The face mask should be removed in a timely manner without moving the head or neck. Pruners FM extractors PVC pipe cutters, trainers, angels and screwdriver can be used to remove the face mask. Although, screwdrivers can be unreliable due to rusty t bolts and screws. If needed, a bag mask valve can be inserted under the face mask to provide ventilation, while the face mask is being removed. If a physician or EMS personnel is available, a more definitive airway can be secured if such intervention is necessary. If this situation is not as urgent, a cervical collar can be placed on the athlete who then is placed on a rigid spine board to ensure mobilization of all segmental levels.

The flow rate should be adjusted to between five and ten liters per minute, and can be adjusted depending on the target saturations. However, it is difficult to know exactly how much oxygen is being delivered through a simple face mask. If a specific concentration of oxygen is tubey delivered, or the patient continues to deteriorate, a venturi mask can be used. These are special adapters, which vary the diameter of flow in order to achieve a specific FIO2. They range from 24 and 60%. The adapters are different colors and display the required flow rate as well as the estimated FIO2. The oxygen is connected up in a similar way to the simple face mask, and the mask is then adjusted to fit on the patient's face. Venturing masks are used in situations where patients may have COPD, or other risk factors for type 2 respiratory failure, and high concentrations of oxygen may need to be avoided. Aim for oxygen saturations of between 88 and 92%. A 28% Venturi mask at 4 litres per minute can be used while some ABG is obtained. If the patient continues to deteriorate or has arrived in a critical condition, a non-rebreathing mask is used to deliver high concentrations of oxygen to the patient. This has an attached reservoir bag and one way valves, which allow oxygen concentrations of 60 to 80 percent to be achieved. Once again,",

So he's able to use two hands now to seal the mask appropriately and then when he says, okay, I've got it, I'm going to attempt to squeeze the bag and I had probably better see a chest rise and fall. If I do not see a chest rise and fall, that air did not go in. No matter how bad I want it to, no chest rise, no chest fall, we did not give the patient a breath. Now, on a side note from there, if there's no way that we can possibly seal this mask to the face of this patient, there's other adjuncts available. It starts getting into advanced life support and advanced airways, but I think it's worth mentioning because many of you use them. We have the superglotic airways that are designed to fit with",

And if you notice, when you're looking at this mask, so there's no valves on this. So this is open to the room air, which is mainly why this device only delivers up to about 55, maybe 60% if I owe two, just because it's mixing with the room air and so you won't get as high concentrations, but it's pretty good for most patients. So easy to set up, all you simply do, you just take one end of your oxygen tubing right here, you're going to take it connected to the end and that's it. You're pretty much ready to go, so let's go over to the flow meter and you can kind of see how we connect it, which is just one easy step. Alright, so now I've got your oxygen mask here, okay, so while holding this in one hand, going to take your other hand and you're going to connect this to your flow meter.

Helping a person breathe by doing rescue breaths and chest compressions is important to keep the brain alive during an overdose. These steps may also be taken if you have given the lock zone to a person who is overdosed and are waiting for the medication to take effect. These are the signs you should look for before beginning rescue breathing and chest compressions. The person is unconscious and not waking up. They don't respond to shouting or rubbing knuckles on the breast bone or between their upper lip and nose. They are not breathing normally. To begin rescue breathing, if the person is not breathing, follow these instructions. Open the person's airway by placing one hand on the forehead and the other hand on the bony part of their chin. Gently tilt the head backward, slightly lift the chin. Make sure their airway is clear, pinch the person's nose shut, and cover their mouth with yours. Take a regular, not a deep breath. Give one rescue breath for one second. Give a second rescue breath for one second. You will know you have given enough air when you see the person's chest begin to rise with the breath you give. As soon as you see chest movement, stop that breath, be careful not to give too much air. If the person's chest doesn't rise on the first breath, try repositioning the head or the airway and try another breath. To give chest compressions",

One of the things that you may need to use is a nebulizer. A lot of times the inhaler is much more convenient. The nebulizer will take a little bit longer, but what it does is it delivers the medication over 10 to 15 minutes. And if you're having really severe symptoms, you may not be able to concentrate to do the proper procedure for the inhaler, which we've talked about before. This allows you to get that medication if you're in really, really bad asthma attack. With this, there's two options it can use. There's a mouthpiece or a mask, which we do for little kids, or if somebody is older and can't hold the mouthpiece. But for most people, the mouthpiece is gonna be the best option, because you're gonna get the medicine done into your lungs instead of into your nose. The mask, if you do have to use a mask, make sure that you do still breathe through your nose or in through your mouth to get the medicine down into your lungs and again it's beneficial because if you're really really tight when you take that inhaler the first dose of medications only going to get to those larger airways and then if if you wait a couple minutes in between the next dose might not get deep enough so take in the inhaler over 10 or",

Techniques for spinal or mobilization and the determination of whether in-line stabilization is required for transport should be left to local protocols or the clinical adjustment and training of the individuals who are on-site. Positioning the head into a spinal neutral position should be assessed on an individual basis.

Typical equipment used includes the vacuum mattress and the rigid spine board. The following are different techniques used for spa boarding and athlete with a cervical spine injury. lift technique. A 6 plus person lift is recommended for all lifts. There should be enough ATC's, MD's and EMS personnel to effectively administer the 6 plus person lift.

So in this video about how to treat an open chest wound using basic first aid techniques, I need to make a couple of quick disclaimers before we begin. The guidelines I'm going to show you come from the faculty of pre-hospital care, the raw college chosen Edinburgh, and therefore maybe slightly different from some of the guidelines taught internationally. Second thing is that this video has been made during the social distancing lockdown, hearing UK due to COVID-19, and therefore, once again, Dave is going to be my casualty. Depending on what training protocol you're familiar with, you may start with Dr. Cab Danger response catastrophic bleed airway breathing, it may be march, massive hemorrhage airway respiration and so on. But breathing, ventilation, respiration, whatever it's called, comes very high in a hold of priority. Probably only after I'm safety, didn't have any massive catastrophic bleed and making sure that the person has an airway. So here we have poor Dave, Dave has been injured in the chest. Now we're looking at why about the mechons of injury too much for the purposes of our video, but we'll say that he's safe here, that I've dealt with many other injuries that I might be worried about, so she's in a large bleed. He's clearly got an airway that he's managing by himself, and he's breathing. However, there's",

First person is that the neck is in control of the turn. The second person is at the shoulders and chest. The third person is that the waste and pelvis, the fourth person is at the knee and lower leg and the fifth person of the team is responsible for checking the alignment once we've done the turn and for tracking pressure soils and doing any kind of nursing care that we are doing the turn for such a changing the sheets or bowel care. So firstly, don't put your hands on the bed like I've just done, but we would ask my personally is the chest person to put their hands on the shoulders and push down to apply counter traction. So when I'm sliding my hands around her neck and down onto her thoracic spine, she doesn't shift. So it'd be very careful not to move her head or neck while I'm doing that and once I've got a good hold counter traction comes off and the rest of the people place their hands at the appropriate level. First in underneath the shoulder been careful not to adjust your hand to make sure we don't move the spine then one of the waist and the next hand is next to that up the hip with the hand going underneath the upper knee. The next hand",

Now the rotator cuff consists of four muscles and what you're going to do is you're going to test the strength of each one. If the causes pain when you test the strength, it's very likely that that particular muscle is causing your pain. So one way to test the rotator cuff, and this is the number one muscle that usually is the problem, is a muscle called the superspinatus muscle. So what you're going to do is you're going to put your arm out in front of you, and then also put your arm out to the side of you, and you're going to go about 30 degrees out from the one from the side. So you put your arm up like this. At 90 degrees, you're going to point your thumb up towards the ceiling. And what you'll do is you'll have a friend or a coworker, try to push your arm down. Now, you could try to do this yourself by using your other hand and pushing, but what I found is another person doing it is a little bit more specific, more sensitivity. So the thing is you'll push down now, if you get pain in the top part of your shoulder, it's very likely that that is an injured rotator cuff, but specifically the superspinatus. test that you can do, because remember there's other muscles, there's four muscles, is to keep your",

But if you're out in a rural area and all you have is a vehicle and no way to call 911, you're going to have to drag good old Chad here into your vehicle and move to the hospital. So there's no simple way to do this. If you have to throw them over your back and stick them in the back seat of the car, that's what you're going to do. The best bet is if you can get EMS, if you can get an ambulance or a helicopter here and they'll have all that equipment to take care of them. If you don't, you do what you got to do in emergency situation, you got to make do with what you got. It's called a critical thinking skill.",

So firstly, don't put your hands on the bed like I've just done, but we would ask my personally is the chest person to put their hands on the shoulders and push down to apply counter traction. So when I'm sliding my hands around her neck and down onto her thoracic spine, she doesn't shift. So it'd be very careful not to move her head or neck while I'm doing that and once I've got a good hold counter traction comes off and the rest of the people place their hands at the appropriate level. First in underneath the shoulder been careful not to adjust your hand to make sure we don't move the spine then one of the waist and the next hand is next to that up the hip with the hand going underneath the upper knee.

This is a teaching video to help those of you who are interested in care of the head and neck injured athlete on the field and transport off the field to the nearest hospital facility. It's extremely important that we manage these people carefully so that we do not worsen their injuries in any way, particularly if they have a neurological deficit. This video will demonstrate the technique of immobilization, how to handle a face mask and remove it carefully, leaving the helmet and chin strapped in place, and the carefully log rolling the patient onto a back board, immobilizing them and they're carefully transporting them to the nearest hospital. These injuries occur with usually contact on the top of the head and an axial neck injury resulting sometimes unconsciousness and or neck injury. Breathing must be controlled and that's why we have to remove the face mask. We should have access to the airway and then a mobilization of the neck if it is a neck injury so that the injury is not worsened any further. Our concern of course with head injuries that we always have to assume there is an associated neck injury. So with that, we'll pass this on to the trainers and the Greenville system to teach us how to manage these specifically on the field of play. The log roll technique is",

The only way to treat this is because you don't know if it's attention to mouth thorax or a simple thorax, as we call this, is to put an occlusive bandage over this and watch chat and see how he's breathing. I can perform my head to toe assessment. In three to four minutes, I want to again take note on how he's breathing. If his condition gets worse, then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and take this occlusive bandage off and just let as much air come out as possible. If he starts to breathe better, then your occlusive bandage is working. Anytime we suspect neck injury, we roll this person as little as possible. Again, if it's an emergency situation, we're going to roll them. If we do have the ability, the time, we can actually put a spine board here in Chad and put him on that spine board and we're going to tape into that board and transport him.

This step is essential for ensuring that the airway is clear and accessible.\n\n3. **Team Coordination**: Assemble a team of responders. Typically, three to five people are needed to perform the log roll safely. Each team member should be assigned a specific role, such as stabilizing the head, torso, and legs.\n\n4. **Log Roll Technique**: On a count, the team should roll the injured person onto their side while maintaining spinal alignment. This is critical for individuals suspected of having a cervical spine injury.\n\n5. **Positioning on Spine Board**: Once rolled, carefully slide the spine board under the individual while ensuring that the head and neck remain stabilized. \n\n6. **Secure the Individual**: After positioning, secure",

          "text": "In this video, let's go over how to fix a crooked lower back quickly and easily stay tuned. Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. So if you have a lower back injury going on and you notice that you are just kind of tilted to one side, that's pretty common with a lumbar disc issue. Your body has a self-defense mechanism that will shift your weight away from the spot of pain. We call that an antelchip position or an antelchip lean. It's also known as a lateral shift to one side. So how we're going to tackle this and get you basically upright and not having a crooked back is by doing three simple exercises that you can do at home. I guess you could do them at work if you really wanted to, but they're really easy. They don't require any special equipment and I think that you'll find that it helps very, very quickly, and might even give you pain relief as in little as 30 seconds. So let's get started with them and get you feeling better right now. So the first exercise is done, Lane flat. You can do this in bed. You can do it on the floor, on a yoga mat. Whatever's more comfortable. But what you want to do is put a pillow underneath the hips, the pelvis, and the stomach right here to offer a little bit more support.

To make the stretch stronger, prop yourself up on the elbows and let the hips and pelvis lies flat as possible. You want to put an arch in the lower back. The advanced stretch in this position would be fully straightening the arms out and getting an intense stretch in the lower back. Go to your comfort levels and hold for up to 15 to 30 seconds and repeat 3 to 5 times. Sitting with good posture at the edge of a chair, place your hands in the small of your back for support and slowly extend your back by arching the spine backwards. Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, relax and repeat 3 to 5 times. For a more intense stretch, press into the small of the back with your hands to help increase the arch, but only go to what is comfortable.

Once this becomes too easy, we can progress even further by then going into a full cobra pose like this. We're just stretching the arms out completely. You want to try to keep the hips, the pelvis flat is possible while doing this. And I tell you why you're going to get a great stretch into the lower back. This is an extension exercise that helps take pressure out of spinal discs and off-pinch nurse, which should help you with your intelligent lean or your crooked back, from their hole for 15 to 30 seconds, relax, repeat it a couple of times.

Find a pole or a sturdy table leg for you to hold onto. I'm using a long heavy bench. This is going to help you anchor down your upper body and allow you back to decompress as you lean back and allow your weight to stretch out your lumbar rectus. With this stretch I don't want you to just sit down like a beautiful squat as this is going to lock your hips into an anterior tilt which is what you want with a body weight squat. So I want you to do exactly the opposite to a beautiful body weight squat or a back squat. So for the purpose of correcting your anterior pelvic tilt we will be tucking our tailbone back and flattening our backs to create posterior hip tilt and decompression in the lower back. I want you to sit down as deep as you can and lean back so you're the weight of your body and your upper body will be pulling in opposite directions. Hold this position for about 1 to 3 minutes. If you want to create more mobility in your lower back hips and heels, just sway back side to side. This is a great way to relieve back pain and get some movement in your joints again.

So we'll create more talk in a lower back and a lower back muscles in the glutes and therefore creating more of a stretch. Hold this position for about eight long controlled breaths. The longer the breath, the more effective the stretch. Do this for about four to five sets on both sides. Loot bridges. Now you've loosened up all those spazzing and tight muscles, this will give us room to solidify the new range of motion with some strengthening exercises. To start, we'll be doing some glute bridges. Once again, don't start off with your hips in an anterior hip tilt and thrust your hips up. This will make your hip extend your lower back and over activate the lower back more than your glute muscles. Just like the previous stretches, I want you to start off by posterior rotating your hips back and tucking your tailbone down and then thrust your hips up in a controlled manner. This was strengthening your glute muscles and your core at the same time in a posterior tilt position. This exercise is going to help improve lower back pain, prevent lower back injuries and reduce your anterior hip tilt. Do about 15 to 20 repetitions for three to four sets. In 2015, the Journal of Physical Therapy Science published a paper on the clinical applications of strengthening",

But if you need to take a breather, what you do is just push back with your hands and kind of pull back with your legs. but try to do about five repetitions of this. And focus on just trying to let the lower back relax as much as you can and let gravity do all of the hard work.

Once we feel that, what we want to do is take that straight leg and slowly raise it up until you feel a really good amount of activation into the core muscles, the lower back, glue, buttocks and legs. You should really feel this one into the core. Strengthening the core is one of the best things that you can do to improve pelvic and lower back posture. Hold this one for about 5 to 10 seconds, relax, take a breather, and then just simply repeat it on the other side.

So I'm going to show variations of extension exercises in different positions. These will include lying on your back, your stomach, seated and standing. They give you many options to experiment with, so give them a try and go with the ones that feel the most comfortable for you. Let's get started and get feeling better right now. For this first exercise, lie on your back with a rolled up towel underneath your lower back. This exercise helps to arch your lower back, relieving pressure on the spinal discs. You can also use larger objects such as a pillow to get more of an arch in the back in a more intense stretch. Hold this position for up to a couple minutes at a time as long as you feel comfortable and repeat. For a more advanced stretch, you can do a ball arch on a stability ball. Roll the ball under you so that your back is flat on the ball. The ball should follow the curve of your spine. Let your back extend over it and go to a position where you feel the lower back starting to relax. Hold this position to create an extension from your upper back to the lower back. For exercises lying on the stomach will go from the least to most intents. First, simply lying down on a flat surface with a pillow under the chest.",

So if you're dealing with an achy tight locked up stiff lower back and need a quick fix, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to show you safe and effective lower back stretches and exercises that that may give instant relief, even as little as 30 seconds. The great part is you can do all of these at home. I'm not going to be using any special equipment other than an everyday racket ball. You can get these locally at a sporting goods department, they're very inexpensive, they're about $1 a piece. So I'm going to break this down into an easy three-step process. We're going to focus on getting rid of muscle knots first, then we're going to stretch everything out, get the lower back moving, and then I'm going to show you a strengthening exercise that will hopefully get rid of lower back tightness for good. So let's get started with them and get the lower back feeling better right now. So in the first part, let's focus on getting rid of those muscle knots, those muscle spasms and the lower back that's causing a lot of tightness. I'm going to lay flat on my back and go up to a door. With this one, you might find it easier to wear shoes because you'll have",

This duration allows your muscles to relax and adapt to the stretch.\n\n4. **Repetition**: Relax and then repeat the exercise up to three to five times. With each repetition, aim to extend a little further towards the desired position [Video 1: EKQCj8LeO_I, Time: 06:19-06:23].\n\n**Safety Note**: If you experience significant pain or discomfort during this exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional.

          "text": "In this video, let's go over how to fix a crooked lower back quickly and easily stay tuned. Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. So if you have a lower back injury going on and you notice that you are just kind of tilted to one side, that's pretty common with a lumbar disc issue. Your body has a self-defense mechanism that will shift your weight away from the spot of pain. We call that an antelchip position or an antelchip lean. It's also known as a lateral shift to one side. So how we're going to tackle this and get you basically upright and not having a crooked back is by doing three simple exercises that you can do at home. I guess you could do them at work if you really wanted to, but they're really easy. They don't require any special equipment and I think that you'll find that it helps very, very quickly, and might even give you pain relief as in little as 30 seconds. So let's get started with them and get you feeling better right now. So the first exercise is done, Lane flat. You can do this in bed. You can do it on the floor, on a yoga mat. Whatever's more comfortable. But what you want to do is put a pillow underneath the hips, the pelvis, and the stomach right here to offer a little bit more support. So for the first part, what I'm going to do is just prop",

Hold this position to create an extension from your upper back to the lower back. For exercises lying on the stomach will go from the least to most intents. First, simply lying down on a flat surface with a pillow under the chest. This will elevate the trunk slightly and put the lower back into slight extension. To make the stretch stronger, prop yourself up on the elbows and let the hips and pelvis lies flat as possible. You want to put an arch in the lower back. The advanced stretch in this position would be fully straightening the arms out and getting an intense stretch in the lower back. Go to your comfort levels and hold for up to 15 to 30 seconds and repeat 3 to 5 times. Sitting with good posture at the edge of a chair, place your hands in the small of your back for support and slowly extend your back by arching the spine backwards. Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, relax and repeat 3 to 5 times. For a more intense stretch, press into the small of the back with your hands to help increase the arch, but only go to what is comfortable. For standing extension, the movement is similar to the seated stretch, slowly extend your lower back by arching backwards, hold for 15 to 30 seconds, relax and repeat three to five times. You can",

Once this becomes too easy, we can progress even further by then going into a full cobra pose like this. We're just stretching the arms out completely. You want to try to keep the hips, the pelvis flat is possible while doing this. And I tell you why you're going to get a great stretch into the lower back.

This exercise is going to help improve lower back pain, prevent lower back injuries and reduce your anterior hip tilt. Do about 15 to 20 repetitions for three to four sets. In 2015, the Journal of Physical Therapy Science published a paper on the clinical applications of strengthening the muscles of the cloutier's groups against doing lumber segmental stabilization exercises. The results showed that there was a greater decrease in lower back pain and an increase in lumber muscles strength and balance ability in the cloutier's groups, compared to the lumber stability exercise group. This is why it decides so much on doing glute strengthening exercises with lower back exercises to prevent lower back pain, strengthening the hips and lower back and prevent injuries in the future. Reverse ab curls. A common mistake with this exercise is starting your back in the arched position. So please flatten your back and rotate your hips back in a posterior tilt position by tucking your tailbone back. Start by lifting up your knees in a bent position, whilst focusing, flattening your back against the ground and in a posterior tilt position slowly and in a controlled manner, lower your feet down to the ground and back up again. Do about 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. If you start this exercise in an anterior pelvic tilt position, you will encourage the activation of the hip flexor muscles instead of the lower",

What I'm going to do is just hold this position. I'm going to tuck my chin towards my chest and really allow my lower body way to just be taken by gravity towards the floor. And this feels like a very good stretch. You should feel it pretty much from the lower back, going all the way down. Hold this position for about 30 seconds. But you can hold it longer if you feel comfortable. 45 seconds all the way up towards a couple minutes. But if you need to take a breather, what you do is just push back with your hands and kind of pull back with your legs. but try to do about five repetitions of this. And focus on just trying to let the lower back relax as much as you can and let gravity do all of the hard work. How we can take this one to the next level is instead of going on our elbows, let's stretch our arms out in front of us as much as we can. Let's",

So we'll create more talk in a lower back and a lower back muscles in the glutes and therefore creating more of a stretch. Hold this position for about eight long controlled breaths. The longer the breath, the more effective the stretch. Do this for about four to five sets on both sides. Loot bridges. Now you've loosened up all those spazzing and tight muscles, this will give us room to solidify the new range of motion with some strengthening exercises. To start, we'll be doing some glute bridges. Once again, don't start off with your hips in an anterior hip tilt and thrust your hips up. This will make your hip extend your lower back and over activate the lower back more than your glute muscles. Just like the previous stretches, I want you to start off by posterior rotating your hips back and tucking your tailbone down and then thrust your hips up in a controlled manner. This was strengthening your glute muscles and your core at the same time in a posterior tilt position. This exercise is going to help improve lower back pain, prevent lower back injuries and reduce your anterior hip tilt. Do about 15 to 20 repetitions for three to four sets.

With this stretch I don't want you to just sit down like a beautiful squat as this is going to lock your hips into an anterior tilt which is what you want with a body weight squat. So I want you to do exactly the opposite to a beautiful body weight squat or a back squat. So for the purpose of correcting your anterior pelvic tilt we will be tucking our tailbone back and flattening our backs to create posterior hip tilt and decompression in the lower back. I want you to sit down as deep as you can and lean back so you're the weight of your body and your upper body will be pulling in opposite directions. Hold this position for about 1 to 3 minutes. If you want to create more mobility in your lower back hips and heels, just sway back side to side. This is a great way to relieve back pain and get some movement in your joints again.

      "answer": "To address a crooked lower back using lying press-ups, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Lie face down on a flat, comfortable surface. Ensure your body is straight and your arms are positioned under your shoulders.\n\n2. **Press-Up Movement**: Slowly push your upper body up using your arms while keeping your hips and pelvis on the ground. This action should create an arch in your lower back. Make sure to engage your abdominal muscles to support your spine during this movement.\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Once you are in the press-up position, hold for a few seconds. This helps to stretch and strengthen the muscles around your lower back.\n\n4. **Repetition**: Gradually lower your upper body back to the starting position and repeat the press-up movement several times. Aim for 10-15 repetitions, depending on your comfort level.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: If you experience pain or discomfort during this exercise, stop immediately. It's important to listen to your body and consult with a healthcare professional if necessary [Video 1: EKQCj8LeO_I, Time: 01:00-01:02]. \n\nThis exercise can help alleviate issues related to lumbar disc problems and promote",

          "text": "In this video, let's go over how to fix a crooked lower back quickly and easily stay tuned. Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. So if you have a lower back injury going on and you notice that you are just kind of tilted to one side, that's pretty common with a lumbar disc issue. Your body has a self-defense mechanism that will shift your weight away from the spot of pain. We call that an antelchip position or an antelchip lean. It's also known as a lateral shift to one side. So how we're going to tackle this and get you basically upright and not having a crooked back is by doing three simple exercises that you can do at home. I guess you could do them at work if you really wanted to, but they're really easy. They don't require any special equipment and I think that you'll find that it helps very, very quickly, and might even give you pain relief as in little as 30 seconds. So let's get started with them and get you feeling better right now. So the first exercise is done, Lane flat. You can do this in bed. You can do it on the floor, on a yoga mat. Whatever's more comfortable. But what you want to do is put a pillow underneath the hips, the pelvis, and the stomach right here to offer a little bit more support. So for the first part, what I'm going to do is just prop",

This next one is based off in the Kinsey method. You can do this one standing. You're are going to do it against a door or a wall. So start off by putting your feet together, they should be spaced about 12 inches away from a wall. You're going to want to put the side that does not hurt, so the good side towards the door. What I'm going to do next is then put the good sides shoulder and arm directly against the door. So my upper body weight is completely flush with it. I should be kind of at an angle. What I'm going to do is take the opposite sides hand, put it at the hip, and then I'm going to drive it towards the door. Just do this very, very slowly. You should start to feel a very good stretch into that crooked lower back. Only go to the point where you feel comfortable.

What you're going to want to do then obviously is start to inch over towards the center line to straighten the back and just keep repeating that process slowly until you feel that you are in a straight neutral position with your back and then from there we're going to slowly start to inch towards the opposite side to get that deeper stretch and really help that intelligent lean. Once this becomes too easy, we can progress even further by then going into a full cobra pose like this. We're just stretching the arms out completely. You want to try to keep the hips, the pelvis flat is possible while doing this. And I tell you why you're going to get a great stretch into the lower back. This is an extension exercise that helps take pressure out of spinal discs and off-pinch nurse, which should help you with your intelligent lean or your crooked back, from their hole for 15 to 30 seconds, relax, repeat it a couple of times. And again, if you feel like you're starting off in a crooked posture, you're going to want to just slowly progress until it's straight and then keep going towards the opposite side to get that extra stretch that is going to help straighten you out.

If we're thinking, if we're talking about anything limited in the front, maybe it's some soft tissue restrictions, maybe it's your pecks, maybe it's the capsule you name it, right?

You want to do this one nice and slowly for about 10 to 15 repetitions on both sides. Again, with each repetition, try to build more into it to hopefully strengthen the lower back and improve posture. An over-look cause of bad rounded back and shoulder posture is because of tight chest muscles that draw us forward. Here is a great two-part exercise that's going to help reduce a lot of chest tightness while also helping to strengthen the upper back. In the first part, we're going to do a basic chest opener. I like to start off by doing a neck retraction take two fingers, place them on the chin, draw the chin and head backwards until you feel a very good activation of the muscles into the neck. from there we're going to go to a corner of a wall. Bend your elbows like this and about 90 degrees, put your feet together and then just stabilize off to the side of the corner right here with your arms and lean forward with your body weight. The more that you lean forward, the more that you're going to feel a very great stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades in the back start to pinch together. Focus on feeling that. Once you hit a very deep but comfortable stretch, let's hold this",

Hold this position to create an extension from your upper back to the lower back. For exercises lying on the stomach will go from the least to most intents. First, simply lying down on a flat surface with a pillow under the chest. This will elevate the trunk slightly and put the lower back into slight extension. To make the stretch stronger, prop yourself up on the elbows and let the hips and pelvis lies flat as possible. You want to put an arch in the lower back. The advanced stretch in this position would be fully straightening the arms out and getting an intense stretch in the lower back. Go to your comfort levels and hold for up to 15 to 30 seconds and repeat 3 to 5 times. Sitting with good posture at the edge of a chair, place your hands in the small of your back for support and slowly extend your back by arching the spine backwards. Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, relax and repeat 3 to 5 times. For a more intense stretch, press into the small of the back with your hands to help increase the arch, but only go to what is comfortable. For standing extension, the movement is similar to the seated stretch, slowly extend your lower back by arching backwards, hold for 15 to 30 seconds, relax and repeat three to five times. You can",

I want your hips against the wall. Your feet can come out from the wall about eight to ten inches, but my hips are against the wall. My shoulder blades are against the wall and the back of my head are against the wall. Now what I'm going to do with my knuckles, I'm going to put them right up here against the wall and then hold my knuckles against the wall. Keep those three points of contact in my spine and then you're just going to slide them up and over your head and then right back down. What you should feel is all those muscles between your shoulder blades going crazy. All those postureal muscles are holding you in this nice posture as we maintain those points of contact and then we just add some active motion to the arms. It's going to really help to stabilize and support and keep everything together nice and tight right where we need it to be. And so typically what I'll do is all either just set a timer. I'll set like a two minute timer for someone to do this or",

So if you're dealing with an achy tight locked up stiff lower back and need a quick fix, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to show you safe and effective lower back stretches and exercises that that may give instant relief, even as little as 30 seconds. The great part is you can do all of these at home. I'm not going to be using any special equipment other than an everyday racket ball. You can get these locally at a sporting goods department, they're very inexpensive, they're about $1 a piece. So I'm going to break this down into an easy three-step process. We're going to focus on getting rid of muscle knots first, then we're going to stretch everything out, get the lower back moving, and then I'm going to show you a strengthening exercise that will hopefully get rid of lower back tightness for good. So let's get started with them and get the lower back feeling better right now. So in the first part, let's focus on getting rid of those muscle knots, those muscle spasms and the lower back that's causing a lot of tightness. I'm going to lay flat on my back and go up to a door. With this one, you might find it easier to wear shoes because you'll have",

So you notice that at one point you got to get into this lunge position. You got to have your arm up overhead, stand tall, and then come back down. Can you even do this balanced with no weight, right? So we want to make sure that this looks good, that this looks clean, and you're not compensating because if you don't have good form and good stability in the rest of your body, you're going to have to make up for it with your shoulder. And this is how people put too much stress on their shoulder. All right, so make sure that you can do lunges well. All right, let's head over to the wall Because I want to show this other cleaner shoulder range of motion test, bring your feet away from the wall, get your low back, and the rest of your back, flat against the wall. Now while treating it, try to keep your elbow straight, try to get your thumbs to the wall. So I'm making sure that I'm keeping my elbow straight, and I'm trying to get my thumbs to the wall. Are you arching in the back? Are your elbows bending? These are all things to be mindful of and to take a look at, but we want to make sure that we can get into this",

Ensure your heels, buttocks, shoulders, and head are touching the wall. This alignment helps you identify your natural posture.\n\n2. **Assess Your Posture**: If you notice that your posture is crooked, gently shift your body to straighten it. Aim to align your spine with the wall. \n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this straightened posture for 15 to 30 seconds. Focus on relaxing your muscles while keeping your back straight against the wall. \n\n4. **Repeat**: After holding the position, relax and then repeat the exercise a couple of times. This helps reinforce the correct posture.\n\n5. **Stretch**: If you feel comfortable, you can progress by gently leaning towards the opposite side of your crooked posture to achieve an extra stretch. This can help in gradually straightening your back [Video 1: EKQCj8LeO_I, Time: 05:51-05:54].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always listen to your body; if you experience pain, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.",

          "text": "Hi, this is Dr. Polodanker, and we're going to go over how to tape the big toe joint for pain underneath the big toe joint, sesmoid pain, sesmoiditis, metatarsalgia. Basically, the goal of the taping is to keep the toe and a planar flexed downward position. The two bones down here, the sesmoids are connected with ligaments. There are tendons that come and attachment this way and typically a strain will create pain around this area. So if you press around you'll typically have a little bit of tenderness swelling pain. So by taping it down it'll relieve some of the tension off the ligaments and the tendons and allow it to heal up. If you are active you might need to cut down your activities, re-evaluate your shoe gear and the taping will allow you to be more comfortable and recover faster. This is a pre-cut KT tape. What you're going to do is basically measure it on the bottom of your foot and cut it so that way it ends at about this level of the big toe joint. I also like to cut one side bigger than the other. It seems to make it easier to stick. So then you peel back these layers. Now remember when you are applying KT tape the beginning and pieces have no tension on them and the middle aspect is where all the tension takes place. After doing this a few times you will also become an expert on taping. So we're going to start from here.",

          "text": "though it's just a toe and even though it's very small, there's really only one way that you can properly treat a broken toe and that is to immobilize it. And when that means is whenever you break a bone, big or small, you have to stop the motion at the joints on either side of that bone. So this may seem like overkill, but the only way to really treat a broken toe is with this, a big walking boot. Now, a lot of people think I'm a little crazy when I say this, because it just looks so big to treat this little broken toe right here. But the problem is not only do you have the motion here, but you've got tendons that start in your leg and go down into your toe and those cause motion of the toe. So a taller walking boot like this is the only way that you can actually stop the motion of those tendons and stop the motion of the foot, because this boot has what's called a rocker on it, so it prevents you from moving it. So getting into this boot as soon as possible is the best way to treat it. First of all, if you do stub your toe, I highly recommend you try not to treat this yourself. Go see Dr. Get an X-ray, but then make sure you get a walking boot. You can find more information on how to treat a broken toe on our website just to do",

So when we talk about numb, big toes, we have a lot of patients that come in, and plenty of numbness along the side of their toes, sometimes tingling, and sometimes pain. There's a very specific reason why this occurs, and it's usually very easy to treat. And by the way, this is the same thing that causes calluses on the side of the toe. So if you look at a normal human step, most of us are going to hit on the outside of every heel, we're going to roll in and we're going to go forward and the big toe joint is going to bend. From the side, it's going to look like this, right? So that's a normal step. Now some people when they walk, their foot rolls in this way too much. And so as it rolls in, the ground presses up under the big toe joint here. And so now when they try to walk forward, that toe joint doesn't bend. And you can try that on yourself. Just Take your shoe off, sit down, have some of me push up under this area here, and try and bend the big toe at won't bend. So, if you can't bend this big toe, your body still has to find some way to move forward. And the way it does it is, instead of bending that toe fully, you end up, let me show",

Then after wrapping it twice around the toe, you go under the adjacent toe that you're going to buddy it to and then go over the top and secure it down. A co-band because it doesn't stick to your skin has to be massaged in where it overlaps so the tape will stick together. And if you have any problems with it slipping off, you can put a little piece of tape, say paper tape or even Scotch tape right in this area to secure the co-band onto the skin. Thank you, Anne.

So, if you can't bend this big toe, your body still has to find some way to move forward. And the way it does it is, instead of bending that toe fully, you end up, let me show you with this foot. Instead of bending forward like that, you end up rolling right off the side of the toe. What that does is that pinches this skin here can cause what are called pinch calluses. And in addition, it can compress the nerves that run right underneath this area. And that's actually what causes that numbness. So when we try and treat this problem, our goal is to go back and get this toe to work through a full range of motion when you walk forward. If we can do that, we can almost always get rid of those symptoms. The most effective way to do that is use shoes that are stable enough to stop your heel from rolling in and you can go to our website and get our shoe list to find those shoes. And the second is to put some sort of orthotic inside your shoe that encourages this bone to go down so that when you walk forward, you have full range of motion in that joint. Now the best orthotics they do that are what are custom orthotics that can form extremely tight to",

So number one, if it's black, blue, it's more likely to be broken, although it's not 100%. If it's deformed, so if your toes like bent like this, right here, very likely there's a good chance that it's broken. Number two, if it's open, that's an emergency. You have to see your penetration at that point. If, as you can see right here, there's a lot of nerves on top of your foot. If you're having severe numbness, burning, tingling, spasms at night, If they onset rapidly, that might mean you have might have some type of nerve injury you probably want to see your doctor. It might be a blood flow injury at the same time. Sometimes it's a blood clot, not a broken toe for some people, though. Young healthy people, that's very unlikely. So if you break your fifth toe right here, it's going to be black and bruised and swollen. The only 100% way to know for sure if it's broken or sprained is to get an x-ray, But generally, in deformity, a black blue swelling really aching throb that doesn't get better after a day or two means that it is broken.

You can see the toes are numbered one for the big toe, two, three, four, five for the pinky toe. When you injure your big toe, you can't body tap it, because it moves too strongly and too differently than the second toe. But if you break your second toe, you can You can buddy tape it to the third. If you break your third toe, you buddy tape it to the second. If you break your fourth toe, you buddy tape it to the third. And if you break your fifth toe, you try to buddy tape it to your fourth, but depends how big the fifth toe is. So Liz is going to demonstrate using co-band, which is a three-amp product, to buddy tape her second toe. which is, we're pretending is injured, to the third toe. Liz takes a six inch piece of co-band and wraps it twice around the injured toe. It's important when you put this tape on that it's not so tight that it causes the toe to throb. You just want some light pressure on the veins to move the swelling out. Then after wrapping it twice around the toe, you go under the adjacent toe that you're going to buddy it to and then go over the top and secure it down. A co-band because it doesn't stick to your skin has to be massaged in where it overlaps so",

The goal is to keep the big toe in a plantar flexed position, which helps alleviate pain associated with sesamoiditis and metatarsalgia [Video 1: bGHe0qCEwGM, Time: 00:50-00:56].\n\n3. **Taping Technique**: Begin by applying a strip of tape around the base of the big toe, anchoring it securely. Then, wrap the tape around the toe, ensuring it maintains the toe in a downward position. This will provide support to the sesamoid bones and the surrounding ligaments.\n\n4. **Final Adjustments**: Make sure the tape is snug but not too tight, as this could restrict blood flow. Check for any signs of discomfort or excessive tightness.\n\n5. **Monitoring**: After taping, observe the patient for any signs of increased pain or circulation issues. If discomfort persists,",

Relax and slowly lift your your head back up again, tilting your chin up towards the ceiling, bring your head back into extension. Hold this for another 30 seconds. Repeat this back and forth 4 to 5 times. When you bring your head into extension, you will stretch the front neck muscles, such as the scaling muscles and squeeze the neck muscles in the back such as the upper trapezius muscles. By bending your head forward, it will switch off the muscles on the back of the neck, such as the upper trapezius muscles. This will promote voluntary control over your neck muscles to reduce basiming in the upper trapezius muscles. Although the purpose of this exercise is to stretch the neck muscles, it will also promote flexion and extension in the cervical spine. This will introduce lubrication in the fedsite joints in the cervical spine and rehydration of the interval discs, between the vertebrae of your cervical spine.

And when you class them, I want you to push into that neck and squeeze that neck as you class. Go ahead and squeeze it. Now what I want you to do, I want you to take your chin and bring your chin to your chest as you continue to squeeze those muscles. And you'll feel those muscles kind of release, and you'll hold it there, about 30 seconds. As you take deep breaths and blow it out, keep squeezing as you let your chin fall on your chest, beautiful. And you'll feel those deep muscles start to release, you'll hold that about 30 seconds. That's a great exercise. We're targeting different muscles behind the neck that attach behind the head That's going to release to give you a lot of relief. The last one I like you to do are chin tucks and shoulder blade squeezes together. The chin tuck, you're going to keep your chin neutral with the floor, do not flex your head forward or backwards.

This will introduce lubrication in the fedsite joints in the cervical spine and rehydration of the interval discs, between the vertebrae of your cervical spine. Therefore, allowing better function for nerves, veins and arteries in the neck, neck rotation. Keep your head squarely over your shoulders in your back straight. Slowly turn your head towards your shoulder until you feel a stretch on the side of the neck and shoulder. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and then slowly turn your head to the other side. This is a good way to assess if the range of motion in your neck is asymmetrical compared to the other side. This is usually presented when you rotate your head and your chin cannot reach as close to your shoulder compared to the other side. This could mean that there could be tightness in the opposing muscles in the neck, or the joints in the sub-gospin are stiff and fixated. By doing these type of exercises, you will promote movement in the neck again and prevent degenerate change in the future, such as arthritis. You can also add some pressure on the side of chin in a controlled manner, to passively move the neck further in rotation. A research paper was published on the effects of neck exercises on cervical genetic headache, which is headaches that are caused from the neck.",

          "text": "Hi, I'm Michelle and welcome to today's video. We're talking about neck pain and when you wake up with a really tight stiff neck. So this is called a rhinoc, it can happen when the joints in your neck become stiff and tight and as a result the muscles over the top of the neck also tighten so that you actually wake when you feel that you can't move your neck at all to maybe to one side or to both sides, it can feel really painful and really debilitating. I'm going to be talking you through this in four steps. The first step is obviously to get some pain relief on board. Take your pain relief before you do anything because while your neck feels painful, that spasm is going to be going to occur and every time you actually feel the pain, you're going to guard by actually tensing enough your neck muscles even more. So step number one, get some good pain relief on board before you do anything. Step number two, use some heat. Now I've got two ways of getting heat here that I like to use. You can either use a warm pack and that can go in the microwave for a couple of minutes before you wrap that around your neck and I'm going to be showing you some ways to use the warm pack. If you don't have a warm pack, that's okay. You can also use another like a wave using a making your temporary warm pack",

Massage tools A common massage tool at home that most people have access to is the foam roller. I highly recommend using one that has foam knobs on it, as they are able to replicate the thumbs that are pressing into the muscles in the back of the neck. Lay down on the floor and place the foam roller on the back of the neck at the base of the skull. Allow the knobs of the foam roller to press into the tender area of the muscles or the trigger point. This is where the majority of the posterior neck muscles attach to the base of the skull and upper neck. These muscles can refer pain locally to the face and the back of the head or behind the eye. Turn your head slightly to the side of the muscle that you want to work on and rock yourself slightly left to right, allowing the foam roller to do its work on the muscle. Try not to use your strength to present to the foam roller. You only need the weight of your head to do most of the work for you. Work on the muscle for 20 seconds on each area, move on to the next and return to the same spot for the",

The first being, the suboxidinal muscles, those small muscles underneath the base of the skull. They tend to get irritated from a lot of forward head posture, think using cell phones, driving computers, everything in the modern world. So let's start off in a chair with very good posture in our back. What I'm going to do is start with my left hand and make a fist. And I'm going to place it right there at the chin. And I'm going to do a simple neck retraction by taking my fist and pressing into the chin. When you do this, you should already start to feel a nice stretch into the neck. This is how we're going to take it to the next level. Let's take our other hand, my right hand, I'm going to place it at the top of my head right here. And the movement is very simple. I'm going to press more into my chin with my fist to do a further neck retraction while pulling down with the top part of my, I should say, my right hand right here and when you do this you're going to feel a wonderful stretch in the top part of the neck",

You'll be able to find a slight crevice under the skull where it finishes and emates the cervical spine. When you add some pressure in this area, it feels slightly tender and you may experience some pain relief. Start by using the pads of your fingertips to press into the muscle belly of the muscle of the back of the neck just under your skull. Working on the muscle fibers from the side of the neck and then back into the middle of the back of the neck again, try not to go past and in front of the side of the neck. This is where the main attachments of the muscles of the neck attaches to the skull. The main one we will be working on that causes the most problems is the sub-oxid-port muscles. Do this for two minutes, have one minute rest and repeat the process again for four to six sets. If you feel like there is more tenderness on the rear sides of the neck, just spend more time in this area.",

This helps to stretch the muscles at the back of your neck. \n\n2. **Side Tilts**: Next, tilt your head to the right, allowing it to fall to the side. You should feel a stretch in the muscles on the opposite side of your neck. Hold this position briefly, then return to the center. Repeat the same motion on the left side to stretch the other side of your neck [Video 1: yPm8Fftp4Dk, Time: 03:02-03:03].\n\n3. **Utilize Head Weight**: As you perform these movements, remember to use the weight of your head (approximately 12 pounds) to enhance the stretch. This natural weight can help deepen the stretch without forcing the muscles [Video 1].\n\n**Safety Note**: Always perform these movements slowly and gently to avoid straining the neck muscles. If you experience any pain, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional.",

Hold this stretch for about eight long deep breaths and alternate on both sides four to five times. And remember to center it this stretch. All you have to do is place the hand on the side that you're trying to stretch under your bum to anchor that side down and then start the stretch. The levator's gap is attached from the cervical spine and insert it onto the superior border of your shoulder blade, also known as the scapula. And the main function on this muscle is to bring the shoulders towards the neck and elevate the shoulder blade towards the neck. Therefore giving it its name, levator scuff. This muscle tends to get tight, especially with whole posture and changes in biomechanics of the body, especially if you tend to spend a lot of time on your phone. At a desk, I'll do a lot of writing, leaning over a laptop. You tend to push your shoulders up and put your head forward, creating a smaller space between the base of your skull and your shoulders Therefore, this muscle gets tightened. It's really important to do this type of stretch to prevent you from degenerative change. For example, arthritis, or pain in the neck, or even headaches in the future.

What this does is help stretch the front, the pack muscles. It's going to hit in between the shoulder blades, the neck right here to loosen everything up while also promoting better posture in our upper backs and neck. It's a wonderful exercise, give it a try. So for this next part we're going to focus on increasing neck flexibility and one of the easiest ways that you can do that is through using a towel.

So I'm going to give you five exercises you can do to relieve the pressure and the pain in your neck. Now, whenever it's what you see, there's a lot of people do some stretches to relieve the pain, but strengthening exercises can also be very, very effective in pain relief from the neck. So, I'll give you two stretches and I'll give you three strengthening exercises to do. And the strengthening exercises, you can view them a bit like some core exercises for your neck, and they strengthen the deep neck muscles. So, the ones that go really deep in your neck, and the sense you stabilize your neck, like your core muscle, which stabilizes your lower back. So, let's start with a couple of stretches. I've done these before. You might have seen them before. The first stretch we're going to do is stretch with the upper trapezius muscle, which runs from the top of your neck to your shoulder and what you need to do. It's hold on to your right wrist, pull your wrist down and therefore you're shoulder down and I'll tilt your left ear to",

It also stretches some of the scaling muscles which can get tight from stress or pore-breathing patterns. To enhance the stretch, place your hand on the side of your hand and pull it down. Another common mistake people tend to do is that over exert themselves by tensing up the neck or the shoulder muscles or raise their shoulder to chate, to touch their ear. By doing this, it will cause you to take shorter breaths and tighten your scaling muscles, which are the muscles that tend to cause thoracic outlet syndrome and radiate pain and tingling down the arm. If you still don't feel a stretch, you can grab the side of the chair and anchor your shoulder down. Or, if you're sitting on a couch or a bed, you can anchor your arm down by sitting on the back side of your hand with your little finger facing towards your knee. Then with the other hand, place it on the side of your head and press lightly with your fingertips. Pulling the side of the head down. The more relaxed your shoulder and your neck muscles are, The more you will feel the stretch, take advantage of the weight of your head and your shoulders to enhance the stretch, forward and backward tilts.

What I want you to do is grab all the sick corners, that's going to make that pillowcase as long as possible, and then just put that over your neck or over your head and behind your neck. Now I mentioned in the introduction here that depending on where that sticky point is or where that pain point happens, it's either going to be higher or lower in your neck. It's important that with this pillow case we isolate that point and so I either want the pillow case up nice and high on my head or depending on where that pain point is I can move it down on my neck. The first thing I want to show you is a mobilization in a rotation motion to your neck. And so for example, pillow cases around my neck, if I can only rotate my head, let's say I'm going to rotate my head to the left and let's say I can only go that far before that pain starts to happen. What I want to do is I want to get this towel right on that spinous process. So right on",

Or, if you're sitting on a couch or your bed, you can anchor your arm down by sitting on the backside of your hand with your little finger facing towards the back of your knee. The levator scap muscle is a muscle that helps elevate the shoulder blade. It inserts on the upper portion of your cervical spine, which is your neck, and attaches to the superior border of the scapula, which is your shoulder blade. Once again, try to do this stretch in a relaxed and controlled manner. Try not to tense up your shoulder or even overexert yourself whilst pulling your neck over. The more you relax your shoulder and neck muscles, the more Before you will feel a stretch, take advantage of the weight of your head and your shoulders to enhance the stretch, advance the levator scapula stretch, raise the arm on the side that you try to stretch forward and reach over the back with your hand grasping the shoulder blade and applying it downwards pressure on the spine of the shoulder blade. This will rotate the shoulder blade downwards, which helps lengthen the levator scapula muscle even more before it's stretched. When you head away from the side, you are trying to stretch.

Hold this side stationary again with this hand, but with this one, what we're going to do is we're going to lift up and then over towards the ceiling, almost at a nice angle, kind of like 45 degrees. So watch how I do this. I'm going to pull, hold this one stationary, and then lift up. I'm almost kind of going through my eye with this. You should feel an upward pull into the neck with this one on top of the rotation. Hold this one for about 10 to 15 seconds. You're just going to relax and then you're going to repeat this up to five times and then just switch to the opposite side to do the same thing with that a great way to just build a little bit more movement into the neck very, very easily with the towel.

This will help guide the stretch effectively.\n\n3. **Stretching**: Gently tilt your head towards the side where your hand is placed. This action will create a stretch along the side of your neck. Be mindful to avoid any jerky movements.\n\n4. **Breathing**: Hold this stretch for about eight long, deep breaths. This allows your muscles to relax and elongate effectively.\n\n5. **Alternating Sides**: After completing the stretch on one side, switch to the other side and repeat the process four to five times on each side. \n\n6. **Centering**: Always remember to center the stretch to ensure balanced flexibility and avoid strain on one side of the neck [Video 1: YRgdQcHziV8, Time: 06:35-06:41].\n\n**Safety Note**: Avoid overstretching or forcing your neck into uncomfortable positions to prevent injury.",

Take a look at this from another view, again, I'm pulling up there, deep stretch that is a area that is usually tied on people with that type of head posture. These stretches can be held for about 10 seconds, and you can do a few sets of those. I recommend at least two, maybe even three sets, again, hold it for about 10 seconds. Alright, and this next stretch here, we're going to stretch more of this side in the front of the neck, usually in area that's tight, that's kind of what pulls that head forward. So we really want to get into the side in the front of the neck. You'll notice my shoulders back. I'm gently reaching around with the other hand and pulling towards the other side.

What we're going to do from there is slowly start to raise our arms up like this so we're touching our fingertips. Hold this for a couple seconds, start to come back down, and then from there, take your chin, drive it back a little bit further, and we're going to also try to bring our arms back a little bit further. And then we're just going to keep repeating that process. And you want to do this about five times. Just keep going back as far as you're able to, nice, slow, controlled movements. What this does is help stretch the front, the pack muscles. It's going to hit in between the shoulder blades, the neck right here to loosen everything up while also promoting better posture in our upper backs and neck. It's a wonderful exercise, give it a try. So for this next part we're going to focus on increasing neck flexibility and one of the easiest ways that you can do that is through using a towel.

There will be some nerves that come from the upper neck and into the head for example the great oxenol nerve and that muscle can cause a lot of pain and headaches around this area as well. So by doing these stretches It will definitely leave you at a lot of pain, but also prevent a lot of pain and prevent a lot of disjuring change and improve your posture in the long run. I hope these stretches help you as much as they help me and my patients. Side tilt. To do the side tilt stretch, just lean your head to the side. Try to touch your ear to your shoulder, hold the position when you start feeling the stretch. 30 seconds or 10 long breaths and repeat this on both sides 4 to 5 times. Try not to tilt your head in rotation. This will place your neck in extension instead, just look straight ahead when you do the head tilt stretch. This mainly stretches the upper trapezius muscle, which is attached to the base of the head to the cervical spine and inserts into shoulders and your upper back. It also stretches some of the scaling muscles which can get tight from stress or pore-breathing patterns. To enhance the stretch, place your hand on the side of your hand and pull it down. Another",

What I want you to do is grab all the sick corners, that's going to make that pillowcase as long as possible, and then just put that over your neck or over your head and behind your neck. Now I mentioned in the introduction here that depending on where that sticky point is or where that pain point happens, it's either going to be higher or lower in your neck. It's important that with this pillow case we isolate that point and so I either want the pillow case up nice and high on my head or depending on where that pain point is I can move it down on my neck. The first thing I want to show you is a mobilization in a rotation motion to your neck. And so for example, pillow cases around my neck, if I can only rotate my head, let's say I'm going to rotate my head to the left and let's say I can only go that far before that pain starts to happen. What I want to do is I want to get this towel right on that spinous process. So right on",

So how we're going to build a little bit more traction to help open up the neck with this exercise, let's grab the ends right here, but let's criss-cross our arms like this. Hold this side stationary again with this hand, but with this one, what we're going to do is we're going to lift up and then over towards the ceiling, almost at a nice angle, kind of like 45 degrees. So watch how I do this. I'm going to pull, hold this one stationary, and then lift up. I'm almost kind of going through my eye with this. You should feel an upward pull into the neck with this one on top of the rotation. Hold this one for about 10 to 15 seconds. You're just going to relax and then you're going to repeat this up to five times and then just switch to the opposite side to do the same thing with that a great way to just build a little bit more movement into the neck very, very easily with the towel. So let's build off that last neck pain exercise with a neck decompression exercise that you can",

Another common mistake people tend to do is that over exert themselves by tensing up the neck or the shoulder muscles or raise their shoulder to chate, to touch their ear. By doing this, it will cause you to take shorter breaths and tighten your scaling muscles, which are the muscles that tend to cause thoracic outlet syndrome and radiate pain and tingling down the arm. If you still don't feel a stretch, you can grab the side of the chair and anchor your shoulder down. Or, if you're sitting on a couch or a bed, you can anchor your arm down by sitting on the back side of your hand with your little finger facing towards your knee.

So for this first at home neck pain relief exercise, I'm going to be using an everyday hand drying towel. So it's just kind of a medium sized towel. Let's roll it up just like this. What I'm going to do is I'm going to put the towel at the base of the skull right here, the top portion of the neck. So I'm just going to kind of put it just like that and then grab the ends of the towel. From here what I want to do is focus on building range of motion into the neck through rotation. That is turning the head from side to side. So if you're having difficulty turning to one side, this is going to really help. Hold one end stationary while the other one then turns the head towards one certain direction. Only go to a point where you feel a very good stretch. You want to hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds, you're just going to relax and then you're going to repeat this up to five times holding for again 15 seconds and then you're just going to go towards the opposite side. Even if the other side doesn't hurt on all of these exercises, you want to do them on both sides to keep the muscles in balance. But the key is only going to your comfort level. So how",

And I'm going to tell you how to know if you have carpal tunnel syndrome, a carpal tunnel syndrome is a pinch nerve in the wrist. The nerve pinching is right here and you will actually get tingling, burning, achiness, a deep-boring type of pain in the thumb, the first finger, The second finger, the middle finger, and half of the ring finger. Carpool Tunnel Syndrome will not give you numbness in the little finger. Very often, sometimes if the nervous pinched up a little higher or more proximal, you'll get a palm type of tingling too. The symptoms will usually be from some type of repetitive motion where you're typing a lot, or you're sleeping in a funny position, or you have a job, there's a lot of vibration to the wrist. In addition to this, most of the time people complain about symptoms at night, because for some reason we're resting or we're sleeping like this, if you can take your hand and put your wrist in this position, get more and more symptoms into this part of the hand, that is very likely carpal tunnel syndrome. Now most people try to wear a brace and the brace is very uncomfortable. So I made another video regarding how to make do it yourself, wrist brace, without causing all the uncomfortable things that occur with normal braces. I'm going to post that video down below. So just look at this.",

One of the good telltale signs is if you squeeze your legs together, like if you put a fist, squeeze your legs together and that hurts in that area, it's a good sign that you pulled a muscle there and pulled a groin muscle. The primary job of a groin is to bring the leg to the midline or to the center, but they do stabilize, they do some flexion. there's no muscle, it just was one thing, right. So there's usually third degrees of injury, three degrees of injury, third degree, three degrees of injury. And the third degree is where you actually tear the muscle. So in that instance, Mike Gess, you're going to be seeing orthopedic surgeon quite often because it's complete tear. So that's very uncommon. I wouldn't think that happens that much. Yeah, we're going to kind of put that to the side. So we're talking about the first degree or second degree tear. Sure. The first thing you're going to want to do is you're going to ice, you're going to start by ice. It's not going to feel very good, you got one? Yeah, we got one right here. And you may do that in a recliner laying down and get that cold pack in there and just relax for 20, 30 minutes, avoid things that irritate it, that make it hurt. Yeah, we actually have an old video, Brad, of how to make an ice pack.",

Don't try to force it. If it's not going to go, it's not going to go. So at that point, visit your local chiropractor instead and get a professional adjustment and the odds are it's going to work a lot better for you anyways. So I hope this helps and give it a try.

Well, how do you know you've sprained your sternoclovicular joint? This is a rare sprained, but it does happen and very often with chronic shoulder problems. I find that the sternoclovicular joint is the thing that no one looks for, but sometimes the secret to getting people's shoulders to feel better. What you do is you have to take your shirt off, look at these bumps right here below your throat. So if you take your finger and you push in the in the soft spot of your throat, the bones are right to the side. And what you'll do is you'll take your finger tips and place them on the actual bones themselves and make sure that they're level. That's clue number one, you've spraying your sternal clavicular joint. Number two, very often the joint will be tender to the touch so when you touch it it'll actually feel like a little bit of a bogginess or swelling. Last test that I do and this is very difficult to do at home motion palpation. And what we do is there's two methods of doing it we can grab the sternal curricular joint and push it down and up and see if it has good motion. The bone should actually move like this. The second way and I like to do it this way is to place",

In this video, I'm going to show you how to treat and fix muscle spasms and nass in the neck in one minute or less. Hey everyone, Dr. Ogg here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. Nack muscle spasms, cramps and muscle nass are common issues that I treat my office. They're usually caused by built-up tension in the upper back and neck from everyday stress, which we all have, and from bad forward leaning posture which we're all guilty of. This is a classic recipe for the creation of muscle spasms and knots and restricted range of motion in the neck. What I'm going to share with you have helped many of my patients get more flexibility back in their neck and help eliminate muscle spasms, cramps, and overall tightness. I'm going to break it down into three parts which will include stretches and exercises targeting the upper, middle, and lower parts of the neck. So it should help you be able to get rid of those muscle spasms no matter where they are. They don't require any special equipment and can be done at home and are really simple to do. So let's get started and get feeling better right now. So for the first part of this guide, we're going to focus on the upper cervical area. Primarily a muscle group called the sub-oxypital muscles.

Does that feel okay? Yeah. To check circulation, squeeze the toenail for five seconds. When you let go, the colour should return within two seconds. If it doesn't, it means the bandages too tight and you need to loosen it off and reapply it. Keep checking the circulation every ten minutes because the ankle may still swell. So remember, when you're bandaging a spray, apply an ice pack and then cover the injury with padding. Apply a roller bandage to hold the ice pack and padding in place and to help support the injury. Check circulation every 10 minutes and keep the injury elevated. And that's how we bandage a spray.",

I'm going to give you realistic advice based on my experience. Now, when you see some people adjusting the foot, you'll see that the person just lying there, they'll grab their foot like this and then just pull. And the patient has their shoe on. Now, that's not very specific, so that person is just doing a long access distraction of, I don't know what joint, I assume the talus, because that's the only one that they can actually get a hold of. But in this video, you're going to see how I go about doing it. Now, we're going to be analyzing the subtailar joint, which is this joint right here between the calcaneous and the talus. I'm going to be analyzing the talus, the navicular bone, which is right there, all three uniforms and the cuboid. So I hope you enjoy this video. If you're a chiropractor and you're adjusting the foot just by grabbing it and then traction it. Hopefully this will give you some other information on how to analyze it because it's these subtleties that actually can make a difference. I'm going to show you this.

Pull the epipend straight out of the leg and make sure not to pull out an angle as this could cause a lot of pain and bleeding. If blood comes out, the drug also comes out. Run the area for about 10 seconds just to help circulate the drug within the muscle of the leg. A second epipen may be administered if the symptoms continue or recur. The person will often feel relief from the tightness in the throat fairly quick. It's often normal for the person to experience side effects from the epinephrine. They may include fast or a pounding heart in the chest, shakiness, feelings of anxiety, dizziness, or even a headache. Once an Epipen has been administered, make sure it's given to the medical professionals. So in conclusion, allergic reactions are never fun to deal with, and they can usually turn what's supposed to be a fun outing into an enormously scary event. But when you understand how to recognize the signs and symptoms and then how to treat them, you can feel confident that even if it does happen, you can be there to take care of your friend, your loved one, or even a perfect stranger.",

If you're feeling pain, you should avoid that activity. And if none of these modifications, whether it's the ice or the activity limitation, avoiding flexion or doing your cat count, if that's not helping to alleviate your symptoms as a important use, you seek professional help.

Similarly, with a lunge, as you lunge forward onto your foot, that knee should be right in line with your toe. If it buckles to the inside, that is an indication that we have some work to do on that lateral hip muscle. Now, of course, I'm curious to hear your results. If you try to any of these tests, Leave me a comment down below. Let me know how they turned out for you. Now, if you do have knee pain and you try these tests and you find out that your hips are weak, obviously, when you need to work on strengthening those hips. What I'd like to do now is run you through a progression of four exercises that are going to help to improve that gluteus medius strength or that hip abductor strength and hopefully help your knee to feel better. Again, there are four exercises I wanna start with easiest and then work up to the hardest. So hopefully we find a solution it's going to be perfect for you. Exercise number one, may seem simple at first glance, but don't count it out. It's actually pretty tough, especially if you're weak in those hip abductors. Let's do some sideline hip abduction. Lay down on your uningered side. That means your injured knee is going to be up towards the",

          "text": "but we're gonna add some weights to it. I wanna talk you guys through each one of these. Let me mention real quick, when we talk about intensity of workouts, you guys have to be monitoring your heart rate. That's the only way that you can see how hard you are working throughout the workout. And then I'm gonna share a really easy formula with you where you can actually determine, oh, I was doing a high intensity workout, or I was staying in this low intensity range. Now to figure out what that range is for you, you take the number 220, you subtract your age. I'm 37, 220 minus 37 is 183. Now I'm gonna multiply that number by 0.5, I get 92, and then I'm also gonna multiply that number by 0.7. I get 128. So in order for this to be a true low intensity steady state cardio activity, I want to monitor my heart rate. I wanted to stay in a 92 to 128 range. That's kind of the 50 to 70% of what we would call your age adjusted maximum heart rate. And so that's the last thing I wanted to mention. If you're following along at home, you're going to take the number two.",

      "answer": "To perform isometric exercises for an unstable knee, it is essential to focus on controlling inflammation and pain while regaining range of motion and minimizing weakness. The initial phase of rehabilitation, particularly for conditions like Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome, emphasizes muscular control training. Before starting any exercises, it is crucial to consult with your physician and physical therapist to ensure safety and appropriateness for your specific condition [Video 1: XMfZT9Hysnc, Time: 01:06-01:12].\n\nIsometric exercises typically involve contracting the muscles without joint movement, which can help stabilize the knee without putting undue stress on it. For instance, you might perform quadriceps sets by tightening the thigh muscle while keeping the leg straight, holding the contraction for several seconds, and then relaxing. This approach helps strengthen the muscles around the knee, providing better support and stability.\n\nIn summary, isometric exercises for an unstable knee should be approached cautiously, focusing on pain control and muscle strengthening, and always under professional guidance to ensure safe practice.",

Occasionally, your baby may have some may spit up and need to have their mouth suction. Sometimes babies will also when they get their first full cold need to have their nose suction as well to help them be able to breathe better. This is the bulb that we use at Women's Hospital and we encourage you to take this bulb home with you and if you care for it properly it can be used throughout your baby's first year or two. When you go to use the bulb syringe I always teach my patients to make a piece sign and then drop it in and then use their thumb. That way you have complete control over the bulb syringe. What you're going to want to do is squeeze out all of the air before you approach your baby. If you need to suction out both the babies mouth and nose, we recommend that you do the mouth first. So what you'll do is you'll insert the bulb syringe into the side of the baby's cheek and go ahead and suction, and then you'll have a towel nearby that you can get all the excess out, and then we'll suction the baby's other side of the cheek and get that out. When it's time to suction your baby's nose, you can occlude one nostril while you",

When it's time to suction your baby's nose, you can occlude one nostril while you put the bulb syringe in the other nostril. You don't have to push it up very far at all, just right inside the tip of the nostril, and then And we'll get whatever's out and we'll repeat on the other side. Once you have finished using your bulb syringe, it's very important that you take care of it and that you clean it after every use. We recommend that you clean it with warm soapy water. So what you'll do is you'll suck up the warm soapy water and then push it out and repeat that a couple of times. When you go to dry the bulb syringe, it's very important that you not store it face up, because we want all of the water to drip out. So I would recommend that you store it on the edge of the sink face down.

Be patient with yourself and your baby remembering that you're both learning. Look for feeding cues and try to latch your baby on before they get upset and start screening. Commonly stroke and talk to your baby. Experiment with different positions to find those that work best for you both. So that it's normal to fill intense burning or steaming for the first 30-60 seconds or so of a nursing session for the first two weeks of your baby's life. But if you continue to fill pain past that point, your baby might be latched improperly. Talk with a lactation specialist who can help you determine if an improper latch is contributing to the pain that you're experiencing. Most women do have sore nipples in the beginning. To relieve this discomfort, either express some of your own breast milk or colostrum and rub that into your nipples or use a lannel in cream. Put a small amount on your finger and rub it in well. Use nipple creams that are specifically designed for breastfeeding because they're purified and you don't have to wash them off before your baby's next feeding. You can also use black tea bags. Soak the tea bags, get them very moist and wet, squeeze out the excess water, then place it on your nipple with a nursing pad over it and leave it there for 15",

Release your grip from the bulb. If the bulb stays flattened, you have successfully reactivated the bulb suction. In the next few hours, you will notice the bulb expanding gradually as it fills with fluid. If the bulb does not expand gradually and collect fluid, call the breast center. Gravity is necessary to keep the drains functioning properly. You must place the bulb below the drain insertion site. Using the plastic tag on the bulb, attach it to your clothing or drain belt. Do not disconnect, bend, compress or puncture the drain tubing. If the drain becomes disconnected or damaged, contact the breast center. The length of time that your drain remains in place depends on the amount of fluid coming from the surgical site. When one drain produces less than 30 milliliters of drainage over a 24 hour period for two days in a row, your drain is ready to be removed. When your drain output meets this criteria, call the breast center, and the nurses will schedule your appointment for your drain to be removed. The drains are usually removed within three weeks",

Your nurse reviews your volume of drainage chart. This information is used to determine if your drains can safely be removed. After you have recorded the amount of fluid from each bulb on your volume of drainage chart, discard the fluid by flushing it down the toilet. In the evening, when you empty and measure your fluid drainage, take your body temperature and record it on the volume of drainage chart. If your body temperature is ever 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, call the breast center. After emptying and measuring the fluid from each bulb, you will need to reactivate the bulb suction.

An electric shock can make your baby unresponsive. If you think your baby's had an electric shock, you'll need to do a baby primary survey.

Second step, inject all the water from the syringe into the bottle. You'll notice that the plunger in the syringe wants to come back out, that's expected. Third, wrap your hand around both the bottle and the syringe and give it a few shakes to give the water a chance to dissolve the tablet. Lastly, you'll have to take the active solution from the bottle and put it back in the syringe. Turn the syringe so the bottle is in the air and push any air that may have come into the syringe back into the bottle and withdraw the active solution from the bottle into the syringe. The glucagon dose ordered by the doctor should be typed on the pharmacy sticker on the outside of the kit. In this example, we will be withdrawing all of the solution. In order to withdraw all of the solution from the bottle, you have to pull the needle about halfway out of the bottle in order to position the tip of the needle at the bottom of the bottle like this.

Shake or stir it to make sure it's fully mixed. This will keep the tube from getting clogged or blocked. Next, you will release the roller clamp and watch as the solution goes down through the tubing. When it starts coming out at the end, roll the clamp back down to stop the flow. Then prepare the catheter and a syringe. The catheter has two ports on the end. One is used for the solution and the other is used to inflate the balloon at the end. The balloon helps the catheter stay in the rectum during the enema. Hold back 15 to 30 ml of air in the syringe and place the syringe on the balloon port. Test the balloon by pushing air into the port and watching the balloon inflate or fill up. the balloon inflates while remove the air from the balloon and prepare your child.

Once again, with the needle in the insulin, pull the plunger back to the unit mark for insulin dose that has been ordered for you. Check that the dose is correct, set the syringe down without letting the needle touch anything. Since you will be injecting your insulin on a regular basis, you need to know where on your body to inject it. You will also need to learn how to rotate or switch your injection sites. Recommended injection sites include the abdomen, front and side of the thighs, upper and outer arms and buttocks. Do not inject near joints, the groin area, the navel, the middle of the abdomen, or scar tissue. If you use the same injection site over and over again, you may get hardened areas under your skin that keep the insulin from working properly. Rotating your injection sites will make your injections easier, safer, and more comfortable. Follow these guidelines. Ask your health care provider which sites you should use. The injection site is about 2 inches of skin. Clean this area in a circular motion with an alcohol wipe. Move the site of each injection. Inject at least one and a half inches away from the last spot where you injected. Try to inject in the same general area of your body at the same time each day. Keep a record of which injection sites you have used. Every time you give yourself an injection right down the",

This helps them feel secure.\n\n3. **Mouth Suction**: If your baby has spit up, gently insert the tip of the bulb syringe into their mouth. Be careful not to insert it too far to avoid gagging. Release the bulb to suction out any mucus or spit-up.\n\n4. **Nose Suction**: If your baby has nasal congestion, gently insert the syringe tip into one nostril. Again, ensure not to insert too deeply. Squeeze the bulb to create suction, then release to remove mucus.\n\n5. **Cleaning**: After use, clean the bulb syringe thoroughly with warm, soapy water to prevent any bacterial growth.\n\n**Safety Note**: Always be gentle and monitor your baby for any signs of distress during the process.

When someone is in shock, they may have a fast pulse, pale, cold or clammy skin, wetting, fast, shallow breathing, grey blue skin, especially inside the lips, weakness and disiness, nausea and possible vomiting, thirst. As the shop becomes more severe, they may have a weak pulse that you may not be able to feel, restless and aggressive behaviour, gasping for air, they may become unresponsive.

The interesting thing about that is that everybody who dies eventually dies from some form of Shack. So when we're talking about emergency first aid, it's one of the things we'll always be watching for, along with airway breathing, circulation, bleeding control, right after we get into that circulation aspect we think about shock symptoms. Shack is sometimes misunderstood as shock like psychogenic shock, or psychologically emotional shock like scared or surprise, but that's not the kind of shock we're talking about. We're talking about one of the many forms of shock, forms meaning we could have spinal shock caused secondary to a spinal cord injury. Cardiogenic shock, primarily from punk failure, hypovalemic shock from loss of fluids or blood, and a philactic shock, which is primarily caused from a severe alerted reaction. And those are the main types of shock we'll see out in the environment. The symptoms are pretty much going to be about the same though, decreased level of consciousness, anxiety, chilled and cold, pale, clammy, poor capillary refill, you pinch the nail bed, usually takes two to three seconds to refill if it takes more than that, we're probably showing a delay in capillary refill, which could be an early sign of shock.

If anybody shows the signs or symptoms of meningitis, like shielding their eyes from the light, then call for an ambulance immediately and treat the fever. Check to see if they have a rash, most rashes will fade when you press the spots under the side of a glass. If the spots don't fade, call for an ambulance immediately. While waiting for an ambulance, reassure them and keep them cool, be sure to check their level of response, pulse and breathing. Remember, call for an ambulance, check for a rash, keep them cool.

Support the injured area, for example, fractures on the arm can be secured against the body with a sling. The fracture to the leg can be secured to the uningid leg with a triangular bandage. Keep checking the person for signs of shock, but do not raise an injured leg. If necessary, raise the uningid leg. If they become unresponsive at any point, prepare to treat an unresponsive casualty. So remember, pad and support the injured area. Use a sling or triangular bandage to keep it secure. Cover any wounds, call 999 or 112. and that's how you treat someone with a fracture.

It's caused by a failure in the circulation, which means that your heart and brain don't have enough circulating the oxygenated blood. It could be due to heart attack, it could be due to an acute allergic reaction, it could be due to a major bleed or all sorts of other reasons that can cause that blood pressure to drop and plummet. If shock is untreated, it can lead to death, so it's a very serious and you need to recognise the signs quickly. The person might be pale, cold, clammy, feeling sick, feeling thirsty, that's all caused because when the body hasn't got enough circulating blood, the body tries to compensate. So your blood vessels can discreet so that they will get the blood to the vital organs. So you could pay a cold and it's a clammy because you don't have as much circulating blood to your skin. You feel sick and thirsty because you don't need all the blood supply to your gut. So draws it away and it's trying to get the blood to your heart and your brain. So imagine that this gentleman has had a major bleed, what you'd be doing is applying pressure really really quickly. So you'd be applying pressure like that. You would be applying a lot of pressure. You'd be having a look and seeing if there's anything in there, but we'll cover all that when we deal with bleeding in a separate video. Okay,",

Why are we addressing posture when we got a pinched nerve? So why don't you show where the nerves come out in the neck on my neck? The nerves, you know, you got the cervical spine here and the nerves come out at an east level. They come out and they actually come down and into the arm, giving innovation to the arm as far as sensation and movement, muscle movement. So if you get a pinching actually in the neck or anywhere along the line you can cause pain down the arm all the way down the arm into the hand right and weakness right as well Isn't that shoulder too? Typically the pinchner we find is in the neck. Yeah, it can be along a line, but majorities is in the neck So in order to keep that mirror from being pinched We find that pore posture, head forward, posture can cause problems where the nerve comes out the frame and the spine itself causing that pinching. So if we just change our posture, it's a critical step. You have to do this because if you try the exercises, the other exercises we're going to show you to help try to decrease the pain, but you don't correct your posture, it's not going to go away. It won't stay away. It's going to come",

That's a sign that we're headed the wrong direction. That's a sign that maybe the exercises that I'm showing you aren't going to be your best option that you need to possibly pursue some other means. So peripheralization, anything that causes symptoms to go further away from your neck is a sign that we're headed in the wrong direction. Now, these symptoms from our neck, these radiating symptoms from our neck, are often caused by posture or position. And so we can get our spine into certain postures into certain positions that kind of open those holes that make them a little wider, create a little more space for the nerve. Those are the types of postures that we want to promote, and those are the things that I'm going to show you in this video.

Now I know it's a pain but the good news is that neck pain usually lasts a couple of weeks and there are also many things that you can do at home to help with this. So what we're waiting for, let's begin. Okay so most cases neck pain is not usually due to a serious condition or a neck problem. In most cases quite often the causes actually a known and we call this non-specific neckpeck. That might be caused by bad posture, sleeping awkwardly, a pinched nerve, a neck injury, and potentially many other reasons too. However, please remember if your neck pain or neck stiffness doesn't go away after a few weeks, painkillers haven't helped say or you just worry about it, or if you have any of the following symptoms like tingling, prickling, numbness sensation, or if your arm is gone cold or your arm hands have become weak, then you need to speak to your doctor as soon as possible and we'll leave a full list in the description below for you as well. So how can it ease the neck pain or stiffness yourself? Well the first thing that you should do is try either a heat or a cold pack on the area of the neck that hurts. So option one, get a hot water bottle, wrap it in",

So if you are next to neck pain, also experiencing like a pain, a numbness, a weakness or a tingling in the arm at the upper arm, the forearm and all the hand, then most likely you've also trapped a nerve. And what we need to do is we need to stretch those nerves to reduce the symptoms in your arm. And these next exercises are going to be very, very beneficial for you. You've got essentially three nerves that run from your neck to your arm. That's the median nerve, the ulum nerve and the radion nerve. And I'm going to demonstrate stretches for each of these nerves. A unique just find which is the most beneficial for you. So just follow me with all these stretches and find out which one works best for you. The first one we're going to demonstrate is the million nerfs, a stretching the million nerf. What we need to do is stand upright, straighten your arm out through the side.

It certainly might help you with this condition as well. I'm going to leave a link to that down below. It's also floating right up here in the screen. make sure you check that out for more of these exercises in even greater detail. Okay, let's get into these exercises. All right, so our first exercise and the one that I probably recommend the most often to most of my cervical patients, most of my patients that had neck pain, are going to be chin tucks. But a lot of the problem that we see with with the neck and with the pinch nerve and the arm pain comes from poor posture, meaning the shoulders are forward, the head is forward, and we get into this position. So we treat it by trying to reverse that. And so your chin tuck. So the first thing you want to do is sit up, straight and tall, and then what I want you to do is focus on tucking your chin, kind of straight back into your net. Keep in mind, it's not a head nod.

Then you can actually apply a little pressure gentle pressure straight down. down. You're compressing the spine together and you're closing off those holes for aiming. And if there's a pinch nerve there from that area, it's going to make it worse. Now, if you just do this, that might be enough to curate it and cause you don't have to kiddo it. You don't have to go any further than it. Same thing, if you're going to do the other side, you're going to extend the head, tilt to that side, and you can, like I said, a little pressure, typically it's the arm that's not involved, because the other one's going to hurt and it kind of gets you out of the way. Now this is the opposite of this, this is, this is, once you check out, see if you get relief from a position. So let's say I'm having pain in this arm here, I'm going to put it on a pillow supported and I'm going to tilt away. And now I'm opening the holes up here, there's plenty of room now for the nerve to come through, it's being supported, and does this give you pain",

If we do the opposite by pulling out it, it's going to relieve the pressure within the disc and cause bulging material to come back in taking the bulge off the nerve. You take the bulge off the nerve, it will start to heal and you'll feel a lot less pain. The main thing that we're going to look for while doing these stretches is less frequent and intense symptoms, but more importantly, what we call centralization. Centralization is a fancy way of saying when you put pressure on a nerve, it will cause us to travel, such as a sharp shooting pain into the shoulder or arms. When you take the pressure off the nerve, the pain starts to move back up to the starting point, which would be in the neck. So this is important to remember, nerve pain heals by slowly moving back towards the starting point. After doing these stretches, if you're feeling less pain and the pain isn't traveling as far, then they are working for you. So let's get started with them and get feeling better right now. So the first decompression stretch that we're going to do is very straightforward. You're going to take your thumbs right here and place them at the back of the head or the base of the skull. If",

All the way down into the fingers. Especially if it goes all the way down into the fingers, that's when you start and think that it might be this sort of thing. Right. So what you're going to do is you're going to turn your neck to the side that you're having pain, turn, and extend, and then you're going to push down. It'd be better if somebody else would actually do it. Right. So I turn, extend, and then push down gently. Now, if that recreates your symptoms, that means you're pinching that nerve, and that means you could possibly have a problem with your neck that's giving you a shoulder pain. And then you better probably go in and have a look that for sure. You can do the other side too, rotate, extend, and then push down. It doesn't take much pressure, and if this is it, it usually triggers it as pretty clear as I, oh, now it's getting worse. Not good, no pain hurts. If you're not paying some of the worst paying, you're going to get. Second one is thoracic outlets syndrome, and in this case, you're getting some pinching up here in the neck and the shoulder in here, some of the muscles, or maybe over the first rib somewhere in here.

Why are we addressing posture when we got a pinched nerve? So why don't you show where the nerves come out in the neck on my neck? The nerves, you know, you got the cervical spine here and the nerves come out at an east level. They come out and they actually come down and into the arm, giving innovation to the arm as far as sensation and movement, muscle movement. So if you get a pinching actually in the neck or anywhere along the line you can cause pain down the arm all the way down the arm into the hand right and weakness right as well Isn't that shoulder too? Typically the pinchner we find is in the neck. Yeah, it can be along a line, but majorities is in the neck So in order to keep that mirror from being pinched We find that pore posture, head forward, posture can cause problems where the nerve comes out the frame and the spine itself causing that pinching. So if we just change our posture, it's a critical step. You have to do this because if you try the exercises, the other exercises we're going to show you to help try to decrease the pain, but you don't correct your posture, it's not going to go away. It won't stay away. It's going to come",

Now, that being said, if we do any activity that causes peripheralization, for example, if you're experiencing kind of that numbness tingling, kind of radiating pain down into your shoulder, we do one of these exercises and all of a sudden pain is down into your elbow, into your arm. That's a sign that we're headed the wrong direction. That's a sign that maybe the exercises that I'm showing you aren't going to be your best option that you need to possibly pursue some other means. So peripheralization, anything that causes symptoms to go further away from your neck is a sign that we're headed in the wrong direction. Now, these symptoms from our neck, these radiating symptoms from our neck, are often caused by posture or position. And so we can get our spine into certain postures into certain positions that kind of open those holes that make them a little wider, create a little more space for the nerve. Those are the types of postures that we want to promote, and those are the things that I'm going to show you in this video. So one thing I want to mention real quick, because our posture is such a strong predictor of a lot of the neck pain and shoulder pain that you might be experiencing, a shot an entire video about how to correct this problem, sharing some of my favorite stretches and exercises to help",

Now I know it's a pain but the good news is that neck pain usually lasts a couple of weeks and there are also many things that you can do at home to help with this. So what we're waiting for, let's begin. Okay so most cases neck pain is not usually due to a serious condition or a neck problem. In most cases quite often the causes actually a known and we call this non-specific neckpeck. That might be caused by bad posture, sleeping awkwardly, a pinched nerve, a neck injury, and potentially many other reasons too. However, please remember if your neck pain or neck stiffness doesn't go away after a few weeks, painkillers haven't helped say or you just worry about it, or if you have any of the following symptoms like tingling, prickling, numbness sensation, or if your arm is gone cold or your arm hands have become weak, then you need to speak to your doctor as soon as possible and we'll leave a full list in the description below for you as well. So how can it ease the neck pain or stiffness yourself? Well the first thing that you should do is try either a heat or a cold pack on the area of the neck that hurts. So option one, get a hot water bottle, wrap it in",

Then you can actually apply a little pressure gentle pressure straight down. down. You're compressing the spine together and you're closing off those holes for aiming. And if there's a pinch nerve there from that area, it's going to make it worse. Now, if you just do this, that might be enough to curate it and cause you don't have to kiddo it. You don't have to go any further than it. Same thing, if you're going to do the other side, you're going to extend the head, tilt to that side, and you can, like I said, a little pressure, typically it's the arm that's not involved, because the other one's going to hurt and it kind of gets you out of the way.

There will be some nerves that come from the upper neck and into the head for example the great oxenol nerve and that muscle can cause a lot of pain and headaches around this area as well. So by doing these stretches It will definitely leave you at a lot of pain, but also prevent a lot of pain and prevent a lot of disjuring change and improve your posture in the long run. I hope these stretches help you as much as they help me and my patients. Side tilt. To do the side tilt stretch, just lean your head to the side. Try to touch your ear to your shoulder, hold the position when you start feeling the stretch. 30 seconds or 10 long breaths and repeat this on both sides 4 to 5 times. Try not to tilt your head in rotation. This will place your neck in extension instead, just look straight ahead when you do the head tilt stretch. This mainly stretches the upper trapezius muscle, which is attached to the base of the head to the cervical spine and inserts into shoulders and your upper back. It also stretches some of the scaling muscles which can get tight from stress or pore-breathing patterns. To enhance the stretch, place your hand on the side of your hand and pull it down. Another",

If we do the opposite by pulling out it, it's going to relieve the pressure within the disc and cause bulging material to come back in taking the bulge off the nerve. You take the bulge off the nerve, it will start to heal and you'll feel a lot less pain. The main thing that we're going to look for while doing these stretches is less frequent and intense symptoms, but more importantly, what we call centralization. Centralization is a fancy way of saying when you put pressure on a nerve, it will cause us to travel, such as a sharp shooting pain into the shoulder or arms. When you take the pressure off the nerve, the pain starts to move back up to the starting point, which would be in the neck. So this is important to remember, nerve pain heals by slowly moving back towards the starting point. After doing these stretches, if you're feeling less pain and the pain isn't traveling as far, then they are working for you. So let's get started with them and get feeling better right now. So the first decompression stretch that we're going to do is very straightforward. You're going to take your thumbs right here and place them at the back of the head or the base of the skull. If",

All right, but if it's fall asleep and you're not really doing anything to it, it could be a pinch of turn around once, Bob. Sure. Another all the way around. I read it. So if you're having pain in the shoulder blade area, that's a good possibility that's coming from the low and neck too. Typically shoulder pain goes down the armor in front of the doesn't refer backwards. So that's another thing to keep in mind as well. And sometimes you get shoulder pain and then it radiates down. Right. Right. So a good point for Adam. So, all right. I'm going to have Mike now put up an image of the nurse in your hand. We have what is called dermatolins in our hands. And when you had the each nerve provides sensation to a certain part of the hand. like the medium nerve is more like the som and the two and a half digits, you know. So if there's numbness and tingling or pain in this area, that might be your median nerve. Sure. All the nerve is over on this side, I think, and then radial nerve is in the back. Right. So all three of these nerves come from different levels, out of the neck. We go down",

So what you're going to do is you're going to turn your neck to the side that you're having pain, turn, and extend, and then you're going to push down. It'd be better if somebody else would actually do it. Right. So I turn, extend, and then push down gently. Now, if that recreates your symptoms, that means you're pinching that nerve, and that means you could possibly have a problem with your neck that's giving you a shoulder pain. And then you better probably go in and have a look that for sure. You can do the other side too, rotate, extend, and then push down. It doesn't take much pressure, and if this is it, it usually triggers it as pretty clear as I, oh, now it's getting worse. Not good, no pain hurts. If you're not paying some of the worst paying, you're going to get. Second one is thoracic outlets syndrome, and in this case, you're getting some pinching up here in the neck and the shoulder in here, some of the muscles, or maybe over the first rib somewhere in here.

Why are we addressing posture when we got a pinched nerve? So why don't you show where the nerves come out in the neck on my neck? The nerves, you know, you got the cervical spine here and the nerves come out at an east level. They come out and they actually come down and into the arm, giving innovation to the arm as far as sensation and movement, muscle movement. So if you get a pinching actually in the neck or anywhere along the line you can cause pain down the arm all the way down the arm into the hand right and weakness right as well Isn't that shoulder too? Typically the pinchner we find is in the neck. Yeah, it can be along a line, but majorities is in the neck So in order to keep that mirror from being pinched We find that pore posture, head forward, posture can cause problems where the nerve comes out the frame and the spine itself causing that pinching. So if we just change our posture, it's a critical step. You have to do this because if you try the exercises, the other exercises we're going to show you to help try to decrease the pain, but you don't correct your posture, it's not going to go away. It won't stay away. It's going to come",

Now, that being said, if we do any activity that causes peripheralization, for example, if you're experiencing kind of that numbness tingling, kind of radiating pain down into your shoulder, we do one of these exercises and all of a sudden pain is down into your elbow, into your arm. That's a sign that we're headed the wrong direction. That's a sign that maybe the exercises that I'm showing you aren't going to be your best option that you need to possibly pursue some other means. So peripheralization, anything that causes symptoms to go further away from your neck is a sign that we're headed in the wrong direction. Now, these symptoms from our neck, these radiating symptoms from our neck, are often caused by posture or position. And so we can get our spine into certain postures into certain positions that kind of open those holes that make them a little wider, create a little more space for the nerve. Those are the types of postures that we want to promote, and those are the things that I'm going to show you in this video. So one thing I want to mention real quick, because our posture is such a strong predictor of a lot of the neck pain and shoulder pain that you might be experiencing, a shot an entire video about how to correct this problem, sharing some of my favorite stretches and exercises to help",

Massage tools A common massage tool at home that most people have access to is the foam roller. I highly recommend using one that has foam knobs on it, as they are able to replicate the thumbs that are pressing into the muscles in the back of the neck. Lay down on the floor and place the foam roller on the back of the neck at the base of the skull. Allow the knobs of the foam roller to press into the tender area of the muscles or the trigger point. This is where the majority of the posterior neck muscles attach to the base of the skull and upper neck. These muscles can refer pain locally to the face and the back of the head or behind the eye. Turn your head slightly to the side of the muscle that you want to work on and rock yourself slightly left to right, allowing the foam roller to do its work on the muscle. Try not to use your strength to present to the foam roller. You only need the weight of your head to do most of the work for you. Work on the muscle for 20 seconds on each area, move on to the next and return to the same spot for the",

So we've got tightness in the front, we've got weakness and a lengthening in the back. And those are the two issues that we need to correct. Those are the two issues that we need to address in order to resolve this postural problem. So let's show you some simple exercises that you can do to take care of that right now. Our first step in correcting this postural issue is to stretch where it's tight. Basically what you don't want to do is start strengthening too early. first you want to create the motion available and then strengthen in that motion. When I say that, what I mean is that we want to get out of this position, we need to stretch up into this position and then this is where we want to spend our time strengthening. So the first couple exercises that I want to show you are designed to kind of get out of this up into this. What you're going to do is grab your foam roller. This is probably my favorite piece of equipment that I have in my physical therapy clinic. We use this for quite a few problems. This is one of my favorite things to use with the foam roller, is actually these postural issues. So this foam roller is 36 inches long and it's a 6 inch diameter, so",

You only need the weight of your head to do most of the work for you. Work on the muscle for 20 seconds on each area, move on to the next and return to the same spot for the six times. Do this on both sides. You should have at least one to three areas of the neck to roll on. Don't be afraid to move the foam roller slightly lower to work on the posterior paraspinal muscles of the neck. The lacrosse ball is a great compact tool that will allow you to be more precise on working on the muscles in the back of the neck and base of the skull. Lay on the floor and carefully rest the back of your head where the muscle is on the lacrosse ball. It will be easier to access the muscle by slightly turning to the side of the muscle that you would like to work on and with your chin slightly pulled back and tucked in. Allow the weight of your head to wrist on the lacrosse ball and move your head slightly left to right, so that the lacrosse ball does some passes of the muscles behind the neck. Do 20 strokes of the muscle belly. Repeat this on both sides four to six times. Peanut massage rollers are one of my favorite tools to use because you can",

There will be some nerves that come from the upper neck and into the head for example the great oxenol nerve and that muscle can cause a lot of pain and headaches around this area as well. So by doing these stretches It will definitely leave you at a lot of pain, but also prevent a lot of pain and prevent a lot of disjuring change and improve your posture in the long run. I hope these stretches help you as much as they help me and my patients. Side tilt. To do the side tilt stretch, just lean your head to the side. Try to touch your ear to your shoulder, hold the position when you start feeling the stretch. 30 seconds or 10 long breaths and repeat this on both sides 4 to 5 times. Try not to tilt your head in rotation. This will place your neck in extension instead, just look straight ahead when you do the head tilt stretch. This mainly stretches the upper trapezius muscle, which is attached to the base of the head to the cervical spine and inserts into shoulders and your upper back. It also stretches some of the scaling muscles which can get tight from stress or pore-breathing patterns. To enhance the stretch, place your hand on the side of your hand and pull it down. Another",

If we do the opposite by pulling out it, it's going to relieve the pressure within the disc and cause bulging material to come back in taking the bulge off the nerve. You take the bulge off the nerve, it will start to heal and you'll feel a lot less pain. The main thing that we're going to look for while doing these stretches is less frequent and intense symptoms, but more importantly, what we call centralization. Centralization is a fancy way of saying when you put pressure on a nerve, it will cause us to travel, such as a sharp shooting pain into the shoulder or arms. When you take the pressure off the nerve, the pain starts to move back up to the starting point, which would be in the neck. So this is important to remember, nerve pain heals by slowly moving back towards the starting point. After doing these stretches, if you're feeling less pain and the pain isn't traveling as far, then they are working for you. So let's get started with them and get feeling better right now. So the first decompression stretch that we're going to do is very straightforward. You're going to take your thumbs right here and place them at the back of the head or the base of the skull. If",

That's the bowl with that foam roller. Okay, the last exercise that I want to show you are going to be what we call wall angels. You're going to come with your back to a wall. I want your hips against the wall. Your feet can come out from the wall about eight to ten inches, but my hips are against the wall. My shoulder blades are against the wall and the back of my head are against the wall. Now what I'm going to do with my knuckles, I'm going to put them right up here against the wall and then hold my knuckles against the wall. Keep those three points of contact in my spine and then you're just going to slide them up and over your head and then right back down. What you should feel is all those muscles between your shoulder blades going crazy. All those postureal muscles are holding you in this nice posture as we maintain those points of contact and then we just add some active motion to the arms. It's going to really help to stabilize and support and keep everything together nice and tight right where we need it to be. And so typically what I'll do is all either just set a timer. I'll set like a two minute timer for someone to do this or",

Why are we addressing posture when we got a pinched nerve? So why don't you show where the nerves come out in the neck on my neck? The nerves, you know, you got the cervical spine here and the nerves come out at an east level. They come out and they actually come down and into the arm, giving innovation to the arm as far as sensation and movement, muscle movement. So if you get a pinching actually in the neck or anywhere along the line you can cause pain down the arm all the way down the arm into the hand right and weakness right as well Isn't that shoulder too? Typically the pinchner we find is in the neck. Yeah, it can be along a line, but majorities is in the neck So in order to keep that mirror from being pinched We find that pore posture, head forward, posture can cause problems where the nerve comes out the frame and the spine itself causing that pinching. So if we just change our posture, it's a critical step. You have to do this because if you try the exercises, the other exercises we're going to show you to help try to decrease the pain, but you don't correct your posture, it's not going to go away. It won't stay away. It's going to come",

Now, that being said, if we do any activity that causes peripheralization, for example, if you're experiencing kind of that numbness tingling, kind of radiating pain down into your shoulder, we do one of these exercises and all of a sudden pain is down into your elbow, into your arm. That's a sign that we're headed the wrong direction. That's a sign that maybe the exercises that I'm showing you aren't going to be your best option that you need to possibly pursue some other means. So peripheralization, anything that causes symptoms to go further away from your neck is a sign that we're headed in the wrong direction. Now, these symptoms from our neck, these radiating symptoms from our neck, are often caused by posture or position. And so we can get our spine into certain postures into certain positions that kind of open those holes that make them a little wider, create a little more space for the nerve. Those are the types of postures that we want to promote, and those are the things that I'm going to show you in this video. So one thing I want to mention real quick, because our posture is such a strong predictor of a lot of the neck pain and shoulder pain that you might be experiencing, a shot an entire video about how to correct this problem, sharing some of my favorite stretches and exercises to help",

Now I know it's a pain but the good news is that neck pain usually lasts a couple of weeks and there are also many things that you can do at home to help with this. So what we're waiting for, let's begin. Okay so most cases neck pain is not usually due to a serious condition or a neck problem. In most cases quite often the causes actually a known and we call this non-specific neckpeck. That might be caused by bad posture, sleeping awkwardly, a pinched nerve, a neck injury, and potentially many other reasons too. However, please remember if your neck pain or neck stiffness doesn't go away after a few weeks, painkillers haven't helped say or you just worry about it, or if you have any of the following symptoms like tingling, prickling, numbness sensation, or if your arm is gone cold or your arm hands have become weak, then you need to speak to your doctor as soon as possible and we'll leave a full list in the description below for you as well. So how can it ease the neck pain or stiffness yourself? Well the first thing that you should do is try either a heat or a cold pack on the area of the neck that hurts. So option one, get a hot water bottle, wrap it in",

Then you can actually apply a little pressure gentle pressure straight down. down. You're compressing the spine together and you're closing off those holes for aiming.

Same thing, if you're going to do the other side, you're going to extend the head, tilt to that side, and you can, like I said, a little pressure, typically it's the arm that's not involved, because the other one's going to hurt and it kind of gets you out of the way.

It's just a Back until you feel the discomfort then come forward If you have the, let's say this is the painful arm, sometimes I'll let that one relax and just grab with one arm. And what you're looking for here, ideally, is we're looking for centralization of the symptoms. What does that mean? Let's see, you're getting pain all the way down the arm into the hand even. What you're looking for first is that it's going to get better in the hand or better in the forearm first. Right, so you",

I hope these stretches help you as much as they help me and my patients. Side tilt. To do the side tilt stretch, just lean your head to the side. Try to touch your ear to your shoulder, hold the position when you start feeling the stretch. 30 seconds or 10 long breaths and repeat this on both sides 4 to 5 times. Try not to tilt your head in rotation. This will place your neck in extension instead, just look straight ahead when you do the head tilt stretch. This mainly stretches the upper trapezius muscle, which is attached to the base of the head to the cervical spine and inserts into shoulders and your upper back. It also stretches some of the scaling muscles which can get tight from stress or pore-breathing patterns. To enhance the stretch, place your hand on the side of your hand and pull it down. Another",

So what you're going to do is you're going to turn your neck to the side that you're having pain, turn, and extend, and then you're going to push down. It'd be better if somebody else would actually do it. Right. So I turn, extend, and then push down gently. Now, if that recreates your symptoms, that means you're pinching that nerve, and that means you could possibly have a problem with your neck that's giving you a shoulder pain. And then you better probably go in and have a look that for sure. You can do the other side too, rotate, extend, and then push down. It doesn't take much pressure, and if this is it, it usually triggers it as pretty clear as I, oh, now it's getting worse. Not good, no pain hurts. If you're not paying some of the worst paying, you're going to get.

If we do the opposite by pulling out it, it's going to relieve the pressure within the disc and cause bulging material to come back in taking the bulge off the nerve. You take the bulge off the nerve, it will start to heal and you'll feel a lot less pain. The main thing that we're going to look for while doing these stretches is less frequent and intense symptoms, but more importantly, what we call centralization. Centralization is a fancy way of saying when you put pressure on a nerve, it will cause us to travel, such as a sharp shooting pain into the shoulder or arms. When you take the pressure off the nerve, the pain starts to move back up to the starting point, which would be in the neck. So this is important to remember, nerve pain heals by slowly moving back towards the starting point. After doing these stretches, if you're feeling less pain and the pain isn't traveling as far, then they are working for you. So let's get started with them and get feeling better right now. So the first decompression stretch that we're going to do is very straightforward. You're going to take your thumbs right here and place them at the back of the head or the base of the skull. If",

Often people have like a numbness or a lack of sensation in these fingers when this nerve is pinched. So let me demonstrate the stretch for you. What you need to do first of all is make an okay sign. So place your index finger on top of your thumb. Then you push arm to the side, you move the elbow back and now we need to to do is you need to turn the hand around, make sure the fingers face towards the floor and place your little finger just behind your ear. So you place your little finger just behind your ear, make sure your fingers are pointing down. Now you need to push your elbow back a little bit, this will give you a stretch. At the top of it all off, what you can do is now tilt your left ear to your left shoulder. Now this is a great stretch for the all on the nerve and again we need to floss it so So what we can do is again, move our head backwards and forwards to get the floss, a floss there's nerve, or we move that through the side and we push our elbow backwards and forwards to get this nerve flossing. So again, you repeat this about 10 times,",

It certainly might help you with this condition as well. I'm going to leave a link to that down below. It's also floating right up here in the screen. make sure you check that out for more of these exercises in even greater detail. Okay, let's get into these exercises. All right, so our first exercise and the one that I probably recommend the most often to most of my cervical patients, most of my patients that had neck pain, are going to be chin tucks. But a lot of the problem that we see with with the neck and with the pinch nerve and the arm pain comes from poor posture, meaning the shoulders are forward, the head is forward, and we get into this position. So we treat it by trying to reverse that. And so your chin tuck. So the first thing you want to do is sit up, straight and tall, and then what I want you to do is focus on tucking your chin, kind of straight back into your net. Keep in mind, it's not a head nod.

Why are we addressing posture when we got a pinched nerve? So why don't you show where the nerves come out in the neck on my neck? The nerves, you know, you got the cervical spine here and the nerves come out at an east level. They come out and they actually come down and into the arm, giving innovation to the arm as far as sensation and movement, muscle movement. So if you get a pinching actually in the neck or anywhere along the line you can cause pain down the arm all the way down the arm into the hand right and weakness right as well Isn't that shoulder too? Typically the pinchner we find is in the neck. Yeah, it can be along a line, but majorities is in the neck So in order to keep that mirror from being pinched We find that pore posture, head forward, posture can cause problems where the nerve comes out the frame and the spine itself causing that pinching. So if we just change our posture, it's a critical step. You have to do this because if you try the exercises, the other exercises we're going to show you to help try to decrease the pain, but you don't correct your posture, it's not going to go away. It won't stay away. It's going to come",

Now, that being said, if we do any activity that causes peripheralization, for example, if you're experiencing kind of that numbness tingling, kind of radiating pain down into your shoulder, we do one of these exercises and all of a sudden pain is down into your elbow, into your arm. That's a sign that we're headed the wrong direction. That's a sign that maybe the exercises that I'm showing you aren't going to be your best option that you need to possibly pursue some other means. So peripheralization, anything that causes symptoms to go further away from your neck is a sign that we're headed in the wrong direction. Now, these symptoms from our neck, these radiating symptoms from our neck, are often caused by posture or position. And so we can get our spine into certain postures into certain positions that kind of open those holes that make them a little wider, create a little more space for the nerve. Those are the types of postures that we want to promote, and those are the things that I'm going to show you in this video. So one thing I want to mention real quick, because our posture is such a strong predictor of a lot of the neck pain and shoulder pain that you might be experiencing, a shot an entire video about how to correct this problem, sharing some of my favorite stretches and exercises to help",

Now I know it's a pain but the good news is that neck pain usually lasts a couple of weeks and there are also many things that you can do at home to help with this. So what we're waiting for, let's begin. Okay so most cases neck pain is not usually due to a serious condition or a neck problem. In most cases quite often the causes actually a known and we call this non-specific neckpeck. That might be caused by bad posture, sleeping awkwardly, a pinched nerve, a neck injury, and potentially many other reasons too. However, please remember if your neck pain or neck stiffness doesn't go away after a few weeks, painkillers haven't helped say or you just worry about it, or if you have any of the following symptoms like tingling, prickling, numbness sensation, or if your arm is gone cold or your arm hands have become weak, then you need to speak to your doctor as soon as possible and we'll leave a full list in the description below for you as well. So how can it ease the neck pain or stiffness yourself? Well the first thing that you should do is try either a heat or a cold pack on the area of the neck that hurts. So option one, get a hot water bottle, wrap it in",

Then you can actually apply a little pressure gentle pressure straight down. down. You're compressing the spine together and you're closing off those holes for aiming.

Same thing, if you're going to do the other side, you're going to extend the head, tilt to that side, and you can, like I said, a little pressure, typically it's the arm that's not involved, because the other one's going to hurt and it kind of gets you out of the way.

So let's say I'm having pain in this arm here, I'm going to put it on a pillow supported and I'm going to tilt away.

So for this first at home neck pain relief exercise, I'm going to be using an everyday hand drying towel. So it's just kind of a medium sized towel. Let's roll it up just like this. What I'm going to do is I'm going to put the towel at the base of the skull right here, the top portion of the neck. So I'm just going to kind of put it just like that and then grab the ends of the towel. From here what I want to do is focus on building range of motion into the neck through rotation. That is turning the head from side to side. So if you're having difficulty turning to one side, this is going to really help. Hold one end stationary while the other one then turns the head towards one certain direction. Only go to a point where you feel a very good stretch. You want to hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds, you're just going to relax and then you're going to repeat this up to five times holding for again 15 seconds and then you're just going to go towards the opposite side. Even if the other side doesn't hurt on all of these exercises, you want to do them on both sides to keep the muscles in balance. But the key is only going to your comfort level. So how",

And with one end of the towel, raise it so it presses up against one of the sides of your jaw. Make sure your neck is nice and relaxed and there is no resistance and then pull the towel over that draw. This will mobilize and stretch the muscles and ligaments that don't really get stretched on rotation in the neck. Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds and then alternate on each side four to five times. Make sure you don't cross the tail under your draw because you will choke yourself out and possibly make yourself pass out or even die and that is not very constructive. Nothing I like to add is make sure you remember to take long breaths in a relaxed manner, deep and slow to allow a more effective stretch, neck flexion and extension mobilizations. Grab both ends of the towel and allow the weight of your arms to pull the towel down. This will add pressure from the behind of the neck from the towel towards the front. This will promote cervical load doses which is a natural curve that you have in your neck in the cervical spine. Now with gentle pressure from the towel flex your neck back and forth in a controlled manner. This will mobilize and open up the cervical spine and promote movement where there",

So for this next part we're going to focus on increasing neck flexibility and one of the easiest ways that you can do that is through using a towel. So if you feel like you just have a lot of locked up tightness where you're just not able to move the head from side to side, this one's gonna work perfectly. Just use an everyday hand drying towel. Place it on the back side of the neck and go over the level that you feel is really the one that needs the most amount of attention. Grab the two ends right here and pull them forward so they're very, or I should say the towel is very tight against the back of the neck. And then what I'm going to do is whatever side that I'm having difficult turning towards, so like let's say I can't turn towards my left, I'm going to take the end on the opposite side and then I'm going to then start to turn my head with the towel while I hold the other end locked and what this does is it helps build nice slow rotation in there into a very nice passive stretch that you can control. Also the towel is going to help massage those neck muscles at the same time. I go to a point where I feel comfortable and I'm going to hold",

For this exercise, do about 20 to 30 reps at one position and move it slightly up from the base of your skull and repeat the process again. Do this three to four times at each position. Remember, This is not an exercise, so your neck shouldn't feel sore, or you shouldn't feel your muscles in your neck at sore. This is a mobilization technique, so you should feel a slight stretch or only a little bit of movement that changes in your neck. You might hear some cracks or pops, but this is perfectly normal. If you want to get more of a dynamic resistance from this exercise, I highly recommend you use a power band. I'll put a link in the description box below on where to get them. It's great to use a resistance band or a power band you might call it because it only increases resistance when it reacts to pressure that you press against it with your neck and",

And if that hurts, it gives you a little bit of pinching, so you're lifting with the other arm. Yep, keep this on plant it on there. So you're getting the chromium and the humerus to come in and pinch, and that's where it gets the name and pinchment because you're internally rotating, so it's pinching those tendons and right. So, so that's, again, the most important one. Number eight, which leads to tendonitis, which we taught, you know, this can lead to and tendonitis to the impingement. So, usually what we see with this bread is like a painful arc we call. Right. See this a lot. Yeah. So, like, here from here to here it doesn't hurt, but, you know, from here to here, oh, oh, because it's pinching, and it's pinching down that tendin. Right. And sometimes it's kind of interesting, where here to here it's fine, and then outward hurts, and then they get through that, and then up here it's fine, because the tendon clears. Right.

Why are we addressing posture when we got a pinched nerve? So why don't you show where the nerves come out in the neck on my neck? The nerves, you know, you got the cervical spine here and the nerves come out at an east level. They come out and they actually come down and into the arm, giving innovation to the arm as far as sensation and movement, muscle movement. So if you get a pinching actually in the neck or anywhere along the line you can cause pain down the arm all the way down the arm into the hand right and weakness right as well Isn't that shoulder too? Typically the pinchner we find is in the neck. Yeah, it can be along a line, but majorities is in the neck So in order to keep that mirror from being pinched We find that pore posture, head forward, posture can cause problems where the nerve comes out the frame and the spine itself causing that pinching. So if we just change our posture, it's a critical step. You have to do this because if you try the exercises, the other exercises we're going to show you to help try to decrease the pain, but you don't correct your posture, it's not going to go away. It won't stay away. It's going to come",

Now, these symptoms from our neck, these radiating symptoms from our neck, are often caused by posture or position. And so we can get our spine into certain postures into certain positions that kind of open those holes that make them a little wider, create a little more space for the nerve. Those are the types of postures that we want to promote, and those are the things that I'm going to show you in this video. So one thing I want to mention real quick, because our posture is such a strong predictor of a lot of the neck pain and shoulder pain that you might be experiencing, a shot an entire video about how to correct this problem, sharing some of my favorite stretches and exercises to help",

Same thing, if you're going to do the other side, you're going to extend the head, tilt to that side, and you can, like I said, a little pressure, typically it's the arm that's not involved, because the other one's going to hurt and it kind of gets you out of the way.

Try to touch your ear to your shoulder, hold the position when you start feeling the stretch. 30 seconds or 10 long breaths and repeat this on both sides 4 to 5 times. Try not to tilt your head in rotation. This will place your neck in extension instead, just look straight ahead when you do the head tilt stretch. This mainly stretches the upper trapezius muscle, which is attached to the base of the head to the cervical spine and inserts into shoulders and your upper back. It also stretches some of the scaling muscles which can get tight from stress or pore-breathing patterns. To enhance the stretch, place your hand on the side of your hand and pull it down. Another",

          "text": "to for a pinch nerve in the neck? You can imagine if there's a lot of downward force being put on the disc causing compression, it's going to pancake the disc and bulge it out. If we do the opposite by pulling out it, it's going to relieve the pressure within the disc and cause bulging material to come back in taking the bulge off the nerve. You take the bulge off the nerve, it will start to heal and you'll feel a lot less pain. The main thing that we're going to look for while doing these stretches is less frequent and intense symptoms, but more importantly, what we call centralization. Centralization is a fancy way of saying when you put pressure on a nerve, it will cause us to travel, such as a sharp shooting pain into the shoulder or arms. When you take the pressure off the nerve, the pain starts to move back up to the starting point, which would be in the neck. So this is important to remember, nerve pain heals by slowly moving back towards the starting point. After doing these stretches, if you're feeling less pain and the pain isn't traveling as far, then they are working for you. So let's get started with them and get feeling better right now. So the first decompression stretch that we're going to do is very straightforward. You're going to take your thumbs right here and place them at the back of the head or the base of the skull. If",

We don't want to have a dislocation like that. So, you can, for all of these, I would put out that warning for all these exercises. Sure. Should we show them a stick? This, this is what I do. And this is what I did. Yeah. Because this made a huge difference for us with a Brad and I both had an impingement of our shoulder. So, the palm goes out, yeah, here, the painful arm. Well, let's keep it the writing. Okay. This would be the the page one. The painful arm, the palm goes out and blow. So the back of your hand would be up against your butt and you got to grab it there and the palm on the top is facing the head. And then you just work it up and work on internal rotation, just like you were with the strap.

Go back to those spots, those muscle spasms in the neck, and put a little bit of pressure in there. Just do a nice self massage for about five seconds to help loosen it up. Now they're going to do a chin tuck towards the chest and then we're going to use our head and bring it backwards into our fingers to build more tension, I'm sorry, build more pressure into those spots of tension. And just give that a good hold for about 15 to 30 seconds. Only go to your comfort level. If it's causing a lot of discomfort back off and just build into a very slowly. What you're going to notice is that that muscle spasm will start to break up. So give that a good 30 second hold or until it does finally release and then back off and keep repeating it until you feel it finally go away. So next, we're going to focus on the middle part of the neck. We're going to target a muscle called the SCM or sternal, chido, mastoid muscle. And this muscle is responsible for turning the head.

Due to the lack of sensitivity and reliability of diagnostic tests that we have at the moment, study has shown that this test cannot be used for diagnosis of sacrilyachron. I'll share with you a link below that you can read more about the option that you have for diagnosis. The reason that I share with you this information that you may need to go and visit your physical therapies for a correct diagnosis before you're trying this routine. The earliest stage of sacrilegal joint management can be similar to other conditions first with minimizing any activity that does aggregate your pain such as running in some cases standing in one leg and also following police and no harm protocol that we have available in our website. I've added those links in this video that you can get access to them and I will suggest to read them. In the meantime, when you're following those two protocols, you're going to follow an exercise rehabilitation routine that I'm going to show you right now. Let's go to the exercise number one and you can start this routine right away. I'm going to start this routine with MET, which is stand for muscle energy technique. I'm going to show you the success size and it can give it a try. You're going to lie down on your back and we'll try to do",

The fourth thing we talked about is a less commonly injured movement is what we call eversion, and that's pointing the toe out to the side.

A good functional assessment is the need to wall test. Number one, put tape on the floor up against the wall. Number two, plant your foot on the tape and try to touch the wall with your knee. Number three, do not let your heel come off the floor. Number four, if your knee doesn't reach the wall, bring your toe closer. Number five, once you're knee can touch the wall, mark the distance of your toe from the wall. Number six, now",

Today we're going to talk about shoulder pain and we're going to discuss some exercises that could help decrease that pain as well as increase your range of motion. First it's important to note that there are several different causes of shoulder pain and each body is different. It's always best to first consult your physical therapist or your doctor to determine which exercises are specifically most appropriate for you. Often times when people have shoulder pain, they try to avoid using it. That might even have their shoulder, closely intensely guarded against their body. One of the most important steps in decreasing your shoulder pain is getting that shoulder to relax. Now, there are different ways that you can do a pencil and exercise. I'm going to show you a way that focuses on relaxing that shoulder. First, come up to a table at a comfortable height. Place the good shoulder down on the table and let the hurting shoulder relax down. Try to make sure that the hurting shoulder is relaxed completely. Then move your body weight forward and back. If this hurting shoulder is relaxed completely, then that shoulder should sway with it forward and back. I recommend trying this exercise for three sets of 15 seconds at least once per day. One of the main functions of the shoulder is to reach up in front of you. If this motion is painful, then",

That's most likely a muscle knot that you've got going on back there. There are some things that you can do to get rid of it. That's why I want to teach you about right now. Before we do that, however, let's talk a little bit more about why these muscle knots occur, why you get these muscle knots so that we can better understand how we treat them. The three main causes that I see, why people develop these muscle knots in their lower back, are going to be weakness, lack of activity, or like a sedentary lifestyle, and then some postural issues as well. Now weakness, we all know how important it is to keep a nice, strong core. If your core is not strong and if you develop weakness over time, that's one of those predisposing factors to causing those muscle knots to get tight and then to not let go. And so weakness is a big thing we're going to show you some strengthening exercises in this video. The second one is a lack of activity or a sedentary lifestyle. Your muscles are designed to move. Your muscles are designed to contract and relax. If you spend all they may be sitting at a desk, sitting on your couch, laying in your bed, whatever you're doing. If you don't live a",

It helps relieve pain and stiffness and to keep people independent. It has proven that regular use of the hands doesn't make osteotriders worse. In fact, it helps maintain joint mobility and hands strength. Therefore, people should be advised to keep using their hands during daily activities and to complete exercises two or three times a week. Hi, I'm Christine. My doctor sent me to see you because he says I have something called Dr. arthritis in my hands and he believes that you can help me by showing me some exercises to do to make the pain less problematic. That's right, exercise can be very helpful for hand osteoarthritis. We know that as part of osteoarthritis, you often lose the strength in your hand. Yes. And you lose the joint mobility, the hands can become stiff. And we know that if we can keep the strength and keep the mobility, then you will have better use in your hands. and exercises can help with that. So we're going to show you some exercises today and what we suggest is that you do them about three times a week with the day of rest between each time that you do them. You need to start gently when you exercise and build up gradually to improve the strength. When you start it can be sore and you can have some pain that lasts, increasing pain that lasts for",

You can just come up this way because sometimes that pull at the end because it's stretching your calf muscle and tightening up that quad muscle so sometimes it feels a little uncomfortable for that pull. But to get the most benefit out of this exercise, I really think pulling out those toes at the end is good. You can use an ankle weight with these sometimes it's not as much of a favorite of mine because it's an open chain when you have more weights on the end sometimes it does put a little stress on that knee joint. So just try it if you want to but if it's a little bit painful I'd go ahead and hold off on doing the the weights for that one. So the last two exercises are gonna be standing up. So in standing that you can do heel toe raises. With heel toe raises I like having my feet about shoulder with a part, just because that kind of opens up the space a little bit, it gives you a little bit better balance. But when you're starting off, make sure and hold on to something. It doesn't really take away from the exercise, but eventually if you want to not hold on, you do get a little bit of a better workout. So when you're doing the heel",

Sometimes when you have an imbalance with these muscles, it can cause issues in your knee and the pubic synthesis. Some athletes even develop arthritis in the groin. Hip, abduction.

If you even do this, bring the head down and it gets worse, right? That's even more of a sign that it might be somewhere along your spinal cord on the dura, right? It's getting pushed and there's getting some pain, so it may be a herniate disc, right? So those are the three quick test bread. Why don't we talk about some of the things that you're typically going to feel when you have herniate disc? Some of the symptoms. Sure, classic symptom number one, you're going to have pain, numbness, and tingling sensations, below the knee down to the knee. Right. But a lot of times you can get pain going down the back of your leg to the knee, and it's not necessary to hurt any of this. There's a lot of other back problems. I'll give you pain that far, right? But once you start going below the knee, that's a pretty good sign. You've got sciatica or a herniated dessert. The other thing is typically it is on one side, right? It's very unusual to go down both legs. If someone says it's going down both legs, I'm thinking spinal stenosis or I'm thinking something else that is not",

You can still increase the pain, the distance till we pinched, but as a general rule of thumb, bending forwards, of course, you're more pain compared to coming backwards. And the last thing you do, which is the gold standard what we call is the straight leg raised tests, and you need a bit of help with this one, and what you do from a partner from anybody else. you lay on your back and say if you argument sick, I've got the pain in my right leg. I have my leg straight and someone raises my leg up, foot back and I normally around in within this range. You will find you will feel this pain in your lower back. Maybe even a pain in your buttocks all down down the back of your hamstring. And that's also a sign of a slip disc. What you can do to aggravate it is to pull your toes towards your nose to make it to see if that makes it any worse or put your chin on your chest.

All of you have probably heard of muscle soreness in general. The technical term is doms, which is a delayed onset of muscle soreness. And so if you've ever overworked out, you really know what muscle soreness or that delayed onset of muscle soreness is all about. A lot of times with doms, You don't feel it until the first 24 or 48 hours and a lot of times when you overdo it more It takes a little bit longer to set in, but you know what it feels like it's kind of like oh my goodness I did way too much and the the top part of that is some of you don't feel like you're doing too much And then you feel it later so that domes delayed onset of muscle soreness is basically You're just doing little micro tears in the muscle and this is actually a good thing this is how you build muscle but sometimes if you do too much those micro fiber tears are a little bit bigger and it just takes longer to recover in this really sore. So a great way to help get rid of muscle soreness is to use kind of a massager or vibration kind of therapy and that really helps relax those muscles and helps them recover. So the folks at massage therapy concepts sent me their",

So by having all those muscles nice and loose, you don't have all that stress on that joint which helps make everything nice and loose. Coming down again in between only needs to be about 10 seconds. It doesn't have to be anything big but you do want to give it a quick break to kind of reset those muscles and then we're going to go into the third one now so just again nice and stretched. Again if you feel like your knee is starting to bend a little bit like that, that means you're pulling it up too much too quickly. So then come back down because you want it to be as straight as it can be. So if that's only to hear that's fine, if that's only to hear that's fine. But again, bring it up as much as you can where you're going. All right, that's a good hurt, hurt so good kind of feeling but not actually pain anywhere. I always like to keep the other knee up because then that takes some pressure off your back. Some people put it straight out. That's okay. You can, but I like to keep it bent, so then you protect your back if you can. All right, so then the next one is going to be a quad stretch the front of the leg.

Just claim our work, just claim our work. Before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button below because it helps my channel grow. I'm going to use the I-releave wireless percussion massage and I'll talk a little bit more about it later. So let's get started. So knee leg pain often comes from tight and sore muscles. So the percussion massages are really great to help relieve that pain in the muscles. And it's really nice because percussion massages get deeper into the muscle tissue. So it's really like a deep massage. And research shows that it's actually just as beneficial or sometimes more beneficial than a traditional massage. So with knee pain, a lot of times the muscles that are causing some of that knee pain are the ones that either cross the knee or the ones that come up to the knee. So the quad muscle is usually a big one, the IT band that starts up at the tensor fascialla or the TFL. The hamstrings in the back, the calf muscles, those crosses well. And then sometimes even the anterior tibialis that doesn't actually cross the joint, but it it comes up to the knee and has a lot to do with it. So it's really nice to get these muscles",

Make sure with this one right here that you only go to your comfort level during this whole exercise, this should not cause any more discomfort. So lane flat, I'm going to do a simple need to the chest. I'm going to lift the leg up on the side of pain where the ball is placed and I'm going to bring that up towards the chest as much as I can. This is a great exercise for lower back pain. It's going to focus on the back leg hamstrings, the glutes, and all of the lower back muscles that are associated with low back pain. Go up to where you feel comfortable and you should already feel a good amount of pressure over that area where the ball is placed. Hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds, relax, do it a couple more times. And this is where the stretch or I should say the exercise gets really good. So let's go back into that knee to the chest position. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to rotate over to the side of pain. So I'm just rotating my whole upper body, I should say my whole body over the spot. And this makes it a really good way to self-release those tight muscles. I hold this one for about 10 to 15 seconds, relax, and then do it upwards to three to five",

      "answer": "To relieve leg pain using knee raises, you can perform the exercise by doing 10 to 20 raises on both sides for three to four sets. This exercise targets the muscles around the knee, which can help strengthen them and potentially alleviate pain. If you find the exercise too easy, you can increase the intensity by adding ankle weights; however, it is crucial to be cautious as this can increase stress on the knee joint. Starting without weights is advisable to ensure proper form and avoid injury [Video 1: N088fFpNoUM, Time: 02:49-02:56].\n\nIn summary, knee raises can be an effective way to strengthen the muscles supporting the knee and relieve leg pain. Begin with bodyweight raises, and only add weights if you feel comfortable. Always prioritize proper technique to minimize the risk of exacerbating any existing knee issues.",

I want my knee at about 90 degrees. What we do is just simply start to rotate that leg towards the opposite direction and you just keep pulling it down until you feel a very good stretch. Only to our comfort level this should not cause any more discomfort if it does please discontinue and then from there what you're going to do is hold that for about 15 seconds And this is how we're going to intensify the stretch. Take one arm straighten it like this. And then slowly start to rotate the upper body and your head towards the opposite direction. So my upper body is rotating towards my left. While this leg right here, my left leg is going towards the opposite direction. And I tell you what, it feels great. This is a wonderful way to get a lot more mobility into the lower back that will help decrease pain and take pressure off the spinal discs. and that sciatic nerve. Hold this one 15 seconds, just simply relax, do it upwards to five times and if you feel comfortable, you can go to the other leg and do",

For standing extension, the movement is similar to the seated stretch, slowly extend your lower back by arching backwards, hold for 15 to 30 seconds, relax and repeat three to five times. You can again press into the small of the back to make the stretch stronger. This exercise is specifically used to treat disc bulges that are pinching nerves off to one side, causing sciatica or leg pain. Start with your feet together, standing about a foot from a wall, the leg that isn't hurting is the one that you want closest to the wall. Bring your elbow to the side and then lean against the wall. Slowly slide your pelvis next to the wall to create a side bend in the spine. Hold the pelvis next to the wall for five seconds and then return to the starting position. Repeat this exercise up to ten times. If your pain is still lingering or getting worse, more sophisticated traction to relieve pressure in the spinal disc is going to be needed to get relief. Look into spinal decompression therapy, which is one of the best conservative options available that can help treat herinated discs and pensioners. I use spinal decompression therapy in my office and have gotten great results with it and have helped a lot of people get long lasting relief without the use",

It's getting pushed and there's getting some pain, so it may be a herniate disc, right? So those are the three quick test bread. Why don't we talk about some of the things that you're typically going to feel when you have herniate disc? Some of the symptoms. Sure, classic symptom number one, you're going to have pain, numbness, and tingling sensations, below the knee down to the knee. Right. But a lot of times you can get pain going down the back of your leg to the knee, and it's not necessary to hurt any of this. There's a lot of other back problems. I'll give you pain that far, right? But once you start going below the knee, that's a pretty good sign. You've got sciatica or a herniated dessert. The other thing is typically it is on one side, right? It's very unusual to go down both legs. If someone says it's going down both legs, I'm thinking spinal stenosis or I'm thinking something else that is not",

I'm just going to bring the leg up like this, and for a lot of the pastes I've had that at her head or her knee, this starts bringing it on right away. You have somewhere in this range, they'll start getting the pain right away, and what you can even do is back off a little bit to the pain is off, and then having to push your toe out toward him, toward his chin, and if that brings it on again, not just stretching pain, but that pain that you've been feeling down and like, that's a pretty positive sign that you're getting sciatic nerve pain that's, you know, that hernia disc is pushing on the nerve and causing pain down the leg.

And so if you've ever overworked out, you really know what muscle soreness or that delayed onset of muscle soreness is all about.

You can even use it for sunburns because it doesn't have that heating up component, it helps relieve that pain. So there's a lot of different things you can use it for, but I've found, like I said, when I was lifting all those rocks, I had 112 bags, 50 pounds each, working and moving those in the yard, and this really helped afterwards with that soreness in that vacuum. Those muscles were really tired, really worked, and this helped kind of calm it down. So I could do those stretches and exercises to help relieve that pain. Got my hands all washed. So now we're gonna go into a single need a chest stretch. And it's just like it sounds, you're bringing your knee up towards your chest. If you have any knee issues, I suggest grabbing underneath and bringing it up, but if you don't, some people like to grab right here, but that just puts a little pressure on your knee. Now some people like to put their other leg all the way down which will help get you a hip flexor stretch a little bit on the other side. I personally, especially",

      "answer": "To relieve leg pain using leg extension, one effective method involves a specific stretching technique aimed at alleviating pressure on spinal discs that may contribute to sciatic pain. Begin by lying down and extending one leg completely straight. Then, take the hand on the opposite side of the leg experiencing pain and hook it behind the knee. This position helps to create a gentle stretch and can relieve tension in the lower back and legs, potentially reducing sciatic discomfort [Video 1: JyBw2EhRZ6U, Time: 02:48-02:52].\n\nThis technique works by promoting spinal alignment and reducing pressure on the affected discs, which can be beneficial for individuals suffering from sciatica or related leg pain. By incorporating this leg extension stretch into your routine, you may experience improved mobility and decreased pain levels. \n\nIn summary, utilizing leg extensions with proper positioning can help alleviate leg pain, particularly when related to sciatic issues.

          "text": "repeat that three times. That's your more advanced version of that bird dog exercise. Our last exercise is going to be some sight-lying hip abduction. Now, a lot of people are not only weak in their core, but their hips as well. And a lot of times, this low back pain is actually the result of some hip abductor weakness. It's these lateral hip muscles that just can't stabilize enough. We've got to create a very stable platform for that low back to kind of move and generate movement around. And so your hips play such a key role in that. We actually spend a lot of time doing some hip strengthening in the treatment of low back pain with really great results. And so for these side lying hip abduction exercises, what you're going to do is lay down on your left side with your left leg bent and your left elbow kind of tucked under you. Your right leg is out straight and then what you're going to do is use those muscles on the side of your hip to raise that straight right leg up towards the ceiling and then straight back down. What I want you to do is focus on pushing that hip forward in front of you as you're doing this exercise. You should feel this muscle more in your glutes then you do more in your hip flexors. That's how you know you're doing it correctly. Shoot for about 10 reps on the right side, roll over and do",

So that one you're moving the whole leg, some of the others we won't be. But again, you know, 10 to 15 on each side just kind of getting everything moving. So this one is going into rotation, which would be an external hip rotation. And it's almost like if you're just going up to cross your leg, like into a figure four. So you're coming up this way.

You can even use it for sunburns because it doesn't have that heating up component, it helps relieve that pain. So there's a lot of different things you can use it for, but I've found, like I said, when I was lifting all those rocks, I had 112 bags, 50 pounds each, working and moving those in the yard, and this really helped afterwards with that soreness in that vacuum. Those muscles were really tired, really worked, and this helped kind of calm it down. So I could do those stretches and exercises to help relieve that pain. Got my hands all washed. So now we're gonna go into a single need a chest stretch. And it's just like it sounds, you're bringing your knee up towards your chest. If you have any knee issues, I suggest grabbing underneath and bringing it up, but if you don't, some people like to grab right here, but that just puts a little pressure on your knee.

A lot of times with doms, You don't feel it until the first 24 or 48 hours and a lot of times when you overdo it more It takes a little bit longer to set in, but you know what it feels like it's kind of like oh my goodness I did way too much and the the top part of that is some of you don't feel like you're doing too much And then you feel it later so that domes delayed onset of muscle soreness is basically You're just doing little micro tears in the muscle and this is actually a good thing this is how you build muscle but sometimes if you do too much those micro fiber tears are a little bit bigger and it just takes longer to recover in this really sore. So a great way to help get rid of muscle soreness is to use kind of a massager or vibration kind of therapy and that really helps relax those muscles and helps them recover.

Today we're using a PVC pipe but you could use anything straight at home like a cane, a golf club or even a broomstick if it was sturdy enough. First what you'll do is put the dowel in both hands but make sure that the hand on the painful shoulder has the palm facing forward. Next, use the good shoulder to push out to your side, hold for a second and then come on down. It's important to note that with this exercise, the painful shoulder should be relaxed the whole time. The good shoulder during this exercise controls the motion on the way up and also controls the motion on the way down. Make sure that you don't bring this stick all the way back behind your head or out too far in front of you. You're trying to bring your bicep up to your ear. It's also important to remember that this motion should not be painful. If it is painful, try going in a shorter pain-free range. I recommend trying this exercise for three sets of 10 once a day.",

So your pier of formus muscle is a muscle that runs from the sacrum to your hip. And the sciatic nerve, which is a muscle that starts in your lower back, and ends hands of all the way around with your toes that normally runs below the belly of the muscle. Now there are three anatomical variations that can cause a compression of the seretic nerve in the period formus muscle. You can have a split nerve where half the nerve runs through the period formus muscle there were being compressed by the muscle. You can have a split period formus muscle where by the nerve runs through the belly of the muscle again being split and we can have a variation where the seretic nerve just doesn't run anywhere we think you'd run and again be compressed by the belly of the piriformis muscle. So I'm going to demonstrate some really effective exercises for you to stretch your piriformis muscle. I'm going to start of easy and I'll have a bit more intense. You can do this at home and it will relieve the pressure on a certain nerve and relieve the pressure on your back, your buttocks and in your leg as well. Now as per usual this video comes with a free exercise sheet. You",

So, for a rush, maybe it hurt up at the top, maybe it hurt within some sort of range, we're thinking rotator cuff or maybe impingement stuff. So now let's go into strength testing. Not necessarily getting a really good gauge of how strong a rush is, but I'm looking for is there any weakness or is there any symptoms. So now a rush, hold real strong here. This is good to do with a friend, but if you don't have a friend, you can always do this with a wall or with a rig. So a rush, hold nice and strong. Don't let me move you. What I'm trying to do is, let me move you, I'm trying to push the rushes arms in. Hold nice and strong. Don't let me move you. We're testing his shoulder external rotators. So the rotator cuff is going to be your infraspinatus, Terry's minor, super spinatus, and then sub-scapularis. The external rotators are going to be your infraspinatus and Terry's minor. Also super",

      "answer": "To relieve leg pain through hip abduction, incorporating exercises that strengthen the hip abductors can be beneficial. Weakness in the hip abductor muscles often contributes to low back pain and may manifest as leg discomfort. Engaging in side-lying hip abduction exercises can target these lateral hip muscles effectively. \n\nDuring the exercise, lie on your side and lift the top leg upward while keeping it straight. This movement activates the gluteus medius and minimus, which are crucial for stabilizing the pelvis and supporting proper alignment of the lower body. Strengthening these muscles can alleviate strain on the lower back and improve overall leg function.\n\nIn summary, performing side-lying hip abduction exercises can help relieve leg pain by addressing hip abductor weakness, which is often a contributing factor to discomfort in the legs and lower back. It is recommended to repeat these exercises multiple times for optimal results [Video 1: GFus5TyIlCM, Time: 07:33-07:34].",

What I want to do is hold this position for about 20 seconds, I'm going to relax, and then I'm going to do this up to five times. begin at that hip is very tight and locked up. You might feel that quick knuckle crack release into the hip very, very quickly. But I try to do this one for five complete repetitions. From there, what I want to do is a more dynamic movement. So that is going through different ranges of motions to target the hip to try to get it to self-release. So from there, what I'm going to do is I'm going to bend forward from the waist, don't round the back with this one. But bend forward from the waist, and you're going to feel the hip and the glute butt-ocket hit just a little bit differently. Do this for about three to five repetitions for holding for about 20 seconds. From there you can then experiment",

So I'm gonna do that before I go back into everything. But again, it's really nice. You can use it for arthritis. You can use it for headaches. You can even use it for sunburns because it doesn't have that heating up component, it helps relieve that pain. So there's a lot of different things you can use it for, but I've found, like I said, when I was lifting all those rocks, I had 112 bags, 50 pounds each, working and moving those in the yard, and this really helped afterwards with that soreness in that vacuum. Those muscles were really tired, really worked, and this helped kind of calm it down. So I could do those stretches and exercises to help relieve that pain. Got my hands all washed. So now we're gonna go into a single need a chest stretch. And it's just like it sounds, you're bringing your knee up towards your chest. If you have any knee issues, I suggest grabbing underneath and bringing it up, but if you don't, some people like to grab right here, but that just puts a little pressure on your knee. Now some people like to put their other leg all the way down which will help get you a hip flexor stretch a little bit on the other side. I personally, especially",

The hip internal rotation is a little more uncomfortable, so just make sure you're ready to do this. But again, now this is a rotation, so I'm not doing that abduction where I'm taking my whole hip out. But I'm actually turning at my knee where my foot's going out, but the top part of my leg is really just staying in one spot. So you can see here where I'm just kind of rolling it out and coming back in. You can roll it out and tap and come back in, which is a little easier, or you can do like I'm doing and leave your foot in the air. And you're really gonna feel that in your hips and your legs, so again, I would just start off with a little bit, see how it feels, and then kind of bump up from there. And so then the last one, then we're gonna go back into that external rotation of the hip but with the band, so we're gonna go back into that kind of figure four motion. But now I have the band, so as I come up, I'm getting that resistance. So you don't have to come up as high as me, but again, you're trying to get that rotation, that external rotation of the hip, and",

All of you have probably heard of muscle soreness in general. The technical term is doms, which is a delayed onset of muscle soreness. And so if you've ever overworked out, you really know what muscle soreness or that delayed onset of muscle soreness is all about. A lot of times with doms, You don't feel it until the first 24 or 48 hours and a lot of times when you overdo it more It takes a little bit longer to set in, but you know what it feels like it's kind of like oh my goodness I did way too much and the the top part of that is some of you don't feel like you're doing too much And then you feel it later so that domes delayed onset of muscle soreness is basically You're just doing little micro tears in the muscle and this is actually a good thing this is how you build muscle but sometimes if you do too much those micro fiber tears are a little bit bigger and it just takes longer to recover in this really sore. So a great way to help get rid of muscle soreness is to use kind of a massager or vibration kind of therapy and that really helps relax those muscles and helps them recover. So the folks at massage therapy concepts sent me their",

So if you just woke up with a kink of a neck, a lot of pinching pain going on, dullness achiness, you name it. This is a really great way to be able to relieve it very quickly. It's a self mobilization technique that is going to focus on all of the motions of the neck. that is rotation or twisting the head to look over your shoulder, bending kind of like taking your ear to your shoulder, and then forward flexion and extension. And I'm going to break it down into three phases that will target each of those motions of the neck. So with the first part, we're going to focus on rotation. We're going to take our towel, roll it up, and just place it on the shoulders for now. Find the spot that really is achy and causing a lot of pain. What you're going to do is take the towel and place it over the level of that spot and just put a little bit of pull in there. Whatever side that it's on is the side that you're going to then lower and lock that down towards the chest. The opposite side saw in this case my left side's hurting my right hand is what's going to do all the work. I'm going to just slowly try to rotate or twist the head towards the left until",

Stay tuned. Hey everyone, Dr. O' here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you've seen any of my other videos, you know I like to keep things simple and straightforward, and in this video, we're going to do a very simple and straightforward exercise that's going to put more rotation, more range of motion into the hip capsule, primarily internal rotation. And we're going to be doing this using an everyday broomstick. If you do not have a broomstick, all you need is something that is long and sturdy. A PVC pipe, you can even go out in the yard and grab a big stick if it works for you. But what we're going to focus on, get everything moving again into the hip. Get that soft tissue loosened up, put more rotation in there so you're you're just able to move around more freely with less pain. Also, as an extra benefit, if your back pain is being caused from the hip, this may also help with that. So again, all of these you can do in the comfort of your own home. They're very safe, they're very effective, and hopefully they're gonna work for you and give you a lot of hip pain relief. So let's get started with them. So I'm gonna show",

          "text": "If you are experiencing a back pain and a batac pain on one side of your body, possibly even a hip pain, and a pain down the leg, you might be suffering from a pier of formus syndrome. So your pier of formus muscle is a muscle that runs from the sacrum to your hip. And the sciatic nerve, which is a muscle that starts in your lower back, and ends hands of all the way around with your toes that normally runs below the belly of the muscle. Now there are three anatomical variations that can cause a compression of the seretic nerve in the period formus muscle. You can have a split nerve where half the nerve runs through the period formus muscle there were being compressed by the muscle. You can have a split period formus muscle where by the nerve runs through the belly of the muscle again being split and we can have a variation where the seretic nerve just doesn't run anywhere we think you'd run and again be compressed by the belly of the piriformis muscle. So I'm going to demonstrate some really effective exercises for you to stretch your piriformis muscle. I'm going to start of easy and I'll have a bit more intense. You can do this at home and it will relieve the pressure on a certain nerve and relieve the pressure on your back, your buttocks and in your leg as well. Now as per usual this video comes with a free exercise sheet. You",

      "answer": "To relieve leg pain through hip rotation, you can perform a specific stretching technique. Start by straightening one leg while placing the other leg over it. Grasp the pant leg of the bent leg and slide it up, then pull the heel back towards you. This movement emphasizes hip rotation and helps in alleviating tension in the leg. As you do this, apply a little body weight into the knee of the bent leg. This action can enhance the stretch and promote better hip mobility, which is beneficial for relieving discomfort in the legs [Video 1: cIWsevPWKkY, Time: 07:23-07:27].\n\nIn summary, incorporating hip rotation exercises, such as the described stretch, can effectively relieve leg pain by improving flexibility and reducing tension in the hip and leg muscles. Regular practice of these movements may contribute to overall lower limb health.",

So I'm not just picking it up and putting it like that. I'm actually bringing the foot up almost like if I was just going across my leg, but I'm not going to do all of that. I'm trying to rotate my hip and that's an external hip rotation. Even though my foot's coming inwards is externally rotated my hip. So again, you know, 10 to 15, make sure you're doing both sides for that. So then the next one we're going to start using a resistive band. So if you haven't done resistive band exercises before, make sure you're using the lightest one because sometimes they feel easy while you're doing them, but then you get really sore afterwards. So this one we're going to go back into the hip flexion exercise, but this time we're using the band. Now the band is not only giving you resistance going up, but it's also going to try and pull your leg in while you're going. So you really want to keep this leg up. You can see how I tried to pull my foot in. So you don't want to do this. You don't want it coming in. You really want to keep it out that same distance down at the bottom where your feet are and then when you're bringing",

So straight forward, 45, and then you're going to go up to 90 for the last 30 seconds. And what that's doing is that's rotating the hip where these muscles connect so we're getting a stretch and the hip as well. Again, one of those things that looks, looks mini-scaled but it can be a little help right. This is just a good stretch. They have good posture, you want to be leaning this way or this way, and while we finish off Brad, what with that dynamic strengthening? Oh yeah, with the band. This is if you can use some ferritool band, you get a wrist or foot strap, foot strap, ankle strap. And with this, how are we doing on it? Yeah, that's fine, if you just, that's all yours. I mean, they don't want to see my face in that anyways. So you see the resistance. I would be very the resistance, obviously, by how far I walk way or by the color of the band. But I'm going to have one flexion. And they can turn 90 degrees. And here, we're going to right directly at those hip abductors at growing muscles, working directly. Right now, don't overwork it when it gets fatigued, stop. But you know, and you could go all for directions. You could work this way. Certainly not going to hurt you. That's",

Once you feel comfortable and there's no pain when you do these exercises anymore, what you can do is basically use a resistant band and that will definitely accentuate the cervical loadosis a lot better. Make sure you get a resistant band that's about 20 to 30 pounds of resistance and you can get these at any sporting goods store. But to add traction, all you need to do is put the resistive band behind your neck and add a little bit of resistance and pulling it forward. This way there is a bit of force that pushes from the back of the neck to the front of the neck. Once this is easy and not painful for you, go from side to side and then once that's easy, go diagonally. About 20 to 30 reps, three sets once again. After a while using the resistive band against your neck, it might hurt because the robot in the resistive band might be cutting into the neck. can do is copy your neck with a towel first and then add a bit of a comfort for yourself.

Make sure you anchor your band down with your feet. I like to do both feet anchors just to make sure that everything is nice and steady and doing how it's supposed to. So going into flexion, we're going to come up this way with the band. So that flexion movement coming in and you're just making sure you get enough tension that's comfortable for you. So you see I had a little bit of slack in there. But if that's too much, you can definitely take your feet away and give it a little bit more slack. a little more resistance. You want to have that band kind of tight the whole time to give you that nice resistance. If you need to put your arm on a table to start off with, you can do that as well, just for some support, but you don't have to, you can just hold it up kind of like I am. You can even prop it on your knee if you want to and going up this way into that flexion, nice all the way down. So you really want to try and get that full",

So you're getting some of the rotation of the rolling, but you're still going out to the side with the band. So I would do more just kind of rolling out like this now. And if you've seen some of my other exercises, this would be like a hook line when I'm lying down, doing like hip abduction and hook line, but you're doing it seated in a chair. So again, you're still working all these leg muscles, but now you're using the band to get yourself a little bit more resistance into it. And again, if you haven't done this before, you probably want to start off with just fire a 10 with the lightest band, then if you get to 20, 25, and it's easy, then you can go up to a higher resistive band. So now I'm going to bring it back down to the feet, and now we're going to do a hip internal rotation with a resistive band. And this one is a little bit tougher for people. The hip internal rotation is a little more uncomfortable, so just make sure you're ready to do this. But again, now this is a rotation, so I'm not doing",

If you still don't feel a stretch in the previous techniques, just raise your foot up and bend your knee and rest it on a wall or a couch. Here, I'm using a bench to rest my rear foot on. This will elongate this quadriceps more in a starting position creating a much more aggressive stretch. With the same principles like the previous stretch, keep your tailbone tucked in and thrust through your hips, nice and slow, and in a controlled manner, and imagine you're pushing an arrow for your hips to the front. However, I do not want you to archer back backwards as this will create more of a back extension than a hip extension. And your hip extension is what we're trying to promote to create a stretch in your hip flexes. You can also target the hip flexes just like the previous stretch by raising your hand up and leaning over to the opposite side. Assisted lower back decompression stretch. Find a pole or a sturdy table leg for you to hold onto. I'm using a long heavy bench. This is going to help you anchor down your upper body and allow you back to decompress",

      "answer": "To relieve leg pain through hip flexion using a resistance band, you can perform an exercise that involves rotating your leg while lifting it. This method engages the hip flexors and can help alleviate discomfort in the legs. \n\nBegin by securing a resistance band around your ankle and anchoring it to a stable surface. While seated or lying down, lift your leg and rotate it outward, mimicking the motion of crossing your leg into a figure four position. It\u2019s important to focus on the movement of the foot and leg together, ensuring that you are not just lifting your leg straight up but also incorporating a rotational element to the movement. This technique can enhance flexibility and strengthen the hip flexors, which may contribute to pain relief in the legs [Video 1: CWVEVBOGNE8, Time: 03:18-03:26].\n\nIn summary, using a resistance band to perform hip flexion with leg rotation can be an effective way to relieve leg pain by promoting mobility and strengthening the associated muscles.",

So I'm not just picking it up and putting it like that. I'm actually bringing the foot up almost like if I was just going across my leg, but I'm not going to do all of that. I'm trying to rotate my hip and that's an external hip rotation. Even though my foot's coming inwards is externally rotated my hip. So again, you know, 10 to 15, make sure you're doing both sides for that. So then the next one we're going to start using a resistive band. So if you haven't done resistive band exercises before, make sure you're using the lightest one because sometimes they feel easy while you're doing them, but then you get really sore afterwards. So this one we're going to go back into the hip flexion exercise, but this time we're using the band. Now the band is not only giving you resistance going up, but it's also going to try and pull your leg in while you're going. So you really want to keep this leg up. You can see how I tried to pull my foot in. So you don't want to do this. You don't want it coming in. You really want to keep it out that same distance down at the bottom where your feet are and then when you're bringing",

So you're getting some of the rotation of the rolling, but you're still going out to the side with the band. So I would do more just kind of rolling out like this now. And if you've seen some of my other exercises, this would be like a hook line when I'm lying down, doing like hip abduction and hook line, but you're doing it seated in a chair. So again, you're still working all these leg muscles, but now you're using the band to get yourself a little bit more resistance into it. And again, if you haven't done this before, you probably want to start off with just fire a 10 with the lightest band, then if you get to 20, 25, and it's easy, then you can go up to a higher resistive band. So now I'm going to bring it back down to the feet, and now we're going to do a hip internal rotation with a resistive band. And this one is a little bit tougher for people. The hip internal rotation is a little more uncomfortable, so just make sure you're ready to do this. But again, now this is a rotation, so I'm not doing",

It's actually pretty tough, especially if you're weak in those hip abductors. Let's do some sideline hip abduction. Lay down on your uningered side. That means your injured knee is going to be up towards the ceiling. Keep your hips stacked one right on top of the other. And then what you're going to do is activate those lateral muscles and lift your heel up towards the ceiling. Try not to let your hips roll backward, try to keep your toe pointed down, and try to drive that heel up towards the ceiling. That's what should be directing this movement. And you should feel that right up on top of your hip. Now this isn't an exercise that I typically recommend we only do 30 to 40 reps of, usually my recommendation here is three sets of 15 to 20 reps. We're really trying to go for fatigue and we're really trying to wear that muscle out in order to stimulate that strength progression. Exercise number 2 is also a sideline abduction exercise, but now we're going to add some resistance. You can do this by grabbing in mini band and sticking it around your knees. Now as you move your leg up towards the ceiling and work on those hip abductors, you have to do so against the resistance at the band. Makes this exercise a little",

          "text": "Exercise number 2 is also a sideline abduction exercise, but now we're going to add some resistance. You can do this by grabbing in mini band and sticking it around your knees. Now as you move your leg up towards the ceiling and work on those hip abductors, you have to do so against the resistance at the band. Makes this exercise a little more difficult. This one I typically recommend about 3 sets of 15 to 20 reps. Next, let's progress things into standing a little more functional position with some lateral band walks. You're still going to need that same mini band, start with it up around your knees, get into a partial squat position, take a big step to the side, and then a half step to follow it. So, a big step with the leading leg, and then a half step with the trailing leg. Depending on the amount of space you have, you might take one step to the left and then one step to the right. If you have more room, you can do an entire walk progression, one direction, and then an entire walk progression back to that starting point. 15 to 20 steps in each direction is a great number to shoot for, and then try to repeat that three times. Now, if you don't have those mini bands or have access to those mini bands, they are inexpensive. They are a great addition to any homework out for any home gym. Check the link down below in",

But again, now this is a rotation, so I'm not doing that abduction where I'm taking my whole hip out. But I'm actually turning at my knee where my foot's going out, but the top part of my leg is really just staying in one spot. So you can see here where I'm just kind of rolling it out and coming back in. You can roll it out and tap and come back in, which is a little easier, or you can do like I'm doing and leave your foot in the air. And you're really gonna feel that in your hips and your legs, so again, I would just start off with a little bit, see how it feels, and then kind of bump up from there. And so then the last one, then we're gonna go back into that external rotation of the hip but with the band, so we're gonna go back into that kind of figure four motion.

Do about 20 to 30 reps of this, this creates a lot of movement in the cervical spine. Once you feel comfortable and there's no pain when you do these exercises anymore, what you can do is basically use a resistant band and that will definitely accentuate the cervical loadosis a lot better. Make sure you get a resistant band that's about 20 to 30 pounds of resistance and you can get these at any sporting goods store. But to add traction, all you need to do is put the resistive band behind your neck and add a little bit of resistance and pulling it forward. This way there is a bit of force that pushes from the back of the neck to the front of the neck. Once this is easy and not painful for you, go from side to side and then once that's easy, go diagonally. About 20 to 30 reps, three sets once again. After a while using the resistive band against your neck, it might hurt because the robot in the resistive band might be cutting into the neck. can do is copy your neck with a towel first and then add a bit of a comfort for yourself.

So straight forward, 45, and then you're going to go up to 90 for the last 30 seconds. And what that's doing is that's rotating the hip where these muscles connect so we're getting a stretch and the hip as well. Again, one of those things that looks, looks mini-scaled but it can be a little help right. This is just a good stretch. They have good posture, you want to be leaning this way or this way, and while we finish off Brad, what with that dynamic strengthening? Oh yeah, with the band. This is if you can use some ferritool band, you get a wrist or foot strap, foot strap, ankle strap. And with this, how are we doing on it? Yeah, that's fine, if you just, that's all yours. I mean, they don't want to see my face in that anyways. So you see the resistance. I would be very the resistance, obviously, by how far I walk way or by the color of the band. But I'm going to have one flexion. And they can turn 90 degrees. And here, we're going to right directly at those hip abductors at growing muscles, working directly. Right now, don't overwork it when it gets fatigued, stop. But you know, and you could go all for directions. You could work this way. Certainly not going to hurt you. That's",

Today we're using a PVC pipe but you could use anything straight at home like a cane, a golf club or even a broomstick if it was sturdy enough. First what you'll do is put the dowel in both hands but make sure that the hand on the painful shoulder has the palm facing forward. Next, use the good shoulder to push out to your side, hold for a second and then come on down. It's important to note that with this exercise, the painful shoulder should be relaxed the whole time. The good shoulder during this exercise controls the motion on the way up and also controls the motion on the way down. Make sure that you don't bring this stick all the way back behind your head or out too far in front of you. You're trying to bring your bicep up to your ear. It's also important to remember that this motion should not be painful. If it is painful, try going in a shorter pain-free range. I recommend trying this exercise for three sets of 10 once a day.",

      "answer": "To relieve leg pain using hip abduction with a resistance band, you can perform specific exercises that engage the hip muscles effectively. Begin by securing a resistance band around your thighs, just above your knees. Stand with your feet hip-width apart. \n\nAs you perform the hip abduction, focus on lifting your leg outward while keeping your body stable. The movement should mimic crossing your leg, where you rotate your leg upward, ensuring that your foot is elevated as you move it away from your body. This technique not only strengthens the hip abductors but also promotes stability in the pelvis, which can alleviate discomfort in the legs [Video 1: CWVEVBOGNE8, Time: 03:18-03:26].\n\nIn summary, using a resistance band for hip abduction exercises can help relieve leg pain by strengthening the surrounding musculature and improving hip stability. Regular practice of this movement can lead to enhanced mobility and reduced pain in the legs.",

So with this one, now the band or the loop band is going to be above my knees, just kind of on my thighs, but right above the knees. not on the knees, and then this is almost just like what we would call maybe like a hip abduction roll out. So you're getting some of the rotation of the rolling, but you're still going out to the side with the band. So I would do more just kind of rolling out like this now. And if you've seen some of my other exercises, this would be like a hook line when I'm lying down, doing like hip abduction and hook line, but you're doing it seated in a chair. So again, you're still working all these leg muscles, but now you're using the band to get yourself a little bit more resistance into it. And again, if you haven't done this before, you probably want to start off with just fire a 10 with the lightest band, then if you get to 20, 25, and it's easy, then you can go up to a higher resistive band. So now I'm going to bring it back down to the feet, and now we're going to do a hip internal rotation with a resistive band. And this one is a little bit tougher for people. The hip internal rotation is a little more uncomfortable, so just make sure you're ready to do this. But again, now this is a rotation, so I'm not doing",

You can roll it out and tap and come back in, which is a little easier, or you can do like I'm doing and leave your foot in the air. And you're really gonna feel that in your hips and your legs, so again, I would just start off with a little bit, see how it feels, and then kind of bump up from there.

Ready? Go. Okay, good. Let me have you stay straight like that. Let me do it a whole more time. Good. And let's do it on the left side. Straight back. Go. Good. Okay. Now, you need to test internal and external rotators. And if you have pain that's chronic or acute and it's reproduced by external or internal rotator testing, that suggests that either as a primary or possibly as a secondary diagnosis you have rotaire cuff involvement and people typically will have pain on the lateral deltoid area. The maneuvers that reproduce the pain most strikingly are the rotaire cuff resistance exercises. I'm going to do it through the opposite. I'm going to have a thumbs point. There is a specific maneuver called superspinatus testing that shows reproduction of pain as consistent with the rotator cuff strength. So again rotator cuff strength can be reproduced with resisted internal rotation, external rotation, or super-spinatus testing. We do one examination for the biceps tendon. We have the patient's arm come up like this, and we put our finger right in here, and we have them do resistance this way. If they have paining anteriorly, especially if",

So it's kind of the same as lying down except this time when you cross over, you're going to be moving your upper body instead of bringing your lower body up to you. So sit up nice and straight, make sure your back is straight and you're just leaning forward at your hips. So I feel that underneath that booty area on this side, the one that you're bringing over to get that stretch. So it's",

From there I'm going to turn my leg in like this to the point where my knee is going to be at 90 degrees. My whole leg is flush against the floor. The other leg can just go straight. When you do this also you want your leg right here the top portion to be in line with the band so don't go at an angle make sure it's nice and straight. You're already going to feel a great pulling motion being built into the hip. What I want to do is use my body way to scoop back even more. With this position we're focusing a little bit more on internal rotation of the hip. So really focus on trying to scoop back as much as you can and allow this band to stretch that hip out. I feel a really good amount right here. So you can hold this for an extended period of time. You can do it for 30 seconds.

Once you feel comfortable and there's no pain when you do these exercises anymore, what you can do is basically use a resistant band and that will definitely accentuate the cervical loadosis a lot better. Make sure you get a resistant band that's about 20 to 30 pounds of resistance and you can get these at any sporting goods store. But to add traction, all you need to do is put the resistive band behind your neck and add a little bit of resistance and pulling it forward. This way there is a bit of force that pushes from the back of the neck to the front of the neck. Once this is easy and not painful for you, go from side to side and then once that's easy, go diagonally. About 20 to 30 reps, three sets once again. After a while using the resistive band against your neck, it might hurt because the robot in the resistive band might be cutting into the neck. can do is copy your neck with a towel first and then add a bit of a comfort for yourself.

Stay tuned. Hey everyone, Dr. O' here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you've seen any of my other videos, you know I like to keep things simple and straightforward, and in this video, we're going to do a very simple and straightforward exercise that's going to put more rotation, more range of motion into the hip capsule, primarily internal rotation. And we're going to be doing this using an everyday broomstick. If you do not have a broomstick, all you need is something that is long and sturdy. A PVC pipe, you can even go out in the yard and grab a big stick if it works for you. But what we're going to focus on, get everything moving again into the hip. Get that soft tissue loosened up, put more rotation in there so you're you're just able to move around more freely with less pain. Also, as an extra benefit, if your back pain is being caused from the hip, this may also help with that. So again, all of these you can do in the comfort of your own home. They're very safe, they're very effective, and hopefully they're gonna work for you and give you a lot of hip pain relief. So let's get started with them. So I'm gonna show",

This setup allows for effective engagement of the hip muscles. Specifically, the resistance band should be placed on your thighs, just above the knees, ensuring it does not rest on the knees themselves. \n\nThe exercise resembles a hip abduction roll-out, which facilitates both hip rotation and abduction. This movement helps strengthen the hip stabilizers and can alleviate discomfort by promoting better alignment and function of the hip joint. Engaging in this exercise can enhance mobility and reduce pain associated with tightness or weakness in the hip region [Video 1: CWVEVBOGNE8, Time: 05:19-05:21].\n\nIn summary, using a resistance band positioned above the knees while performing hip internal rotation exercises can be beneficial in relieving leg pain by strengthening the hip muscles and improving joint function.",

So I'm not just picking it up and putting it like that. I'm actually bringing the foot up almost like if I was just going across my leg, but I'm not going to do all of that. I'm trying to rotate my hip and that's an external hip rotation. Even though my foot's coming inwards is externally rotated my hip. So again, you know, 10 to 15, make sure you're doing both sides for that. So then the next one we're going to start using a resistive band. So if you haven't done resistive band exercises before, make sure you're using the lightest one because sometimes they feel easy while you're doing them, but then you get really sore afterwards. So this one we're going to go back into the hip flexion exercise, but this time we're using the band. Now the band is not only giving you resistance going up, but it's also going to try and pull your leg in while you're going. So you really want to keep this leg up. You can see how I tried to pull my foot in. So you don't want to do this. You don't want it coming in. You really want to keep it out that same distance down at the bottom where your feet are and then when you're bringing",

Ready? Go. Okay, good. Let me have you stay straight like that. Let me do it a whole more time. Good. And let's do it on the left side. Straight back. Go. Good. Okay. Now, you need to test internal and external rotators. And if you have pain that's chronic or acute and it's reproduced by external or internal rotator testing, that suggests that either as a primary or possibly as a secondary diagnosis you have rotaire cuff involvement and people typically will have pain on the lateral deltoid area. The maneuvers that reproduce the pain most strikingly are the rotaire cuff resistance exercises. I'm going to do it through the opposite. I'm going to have a thumbs point. There is a specific maneuver called superspinatus testing that shows reproduction of pain as consistent with the rotator cuff strength. So again rotator cuff strength can be reproduced with resisted internal rotation, external rotation, or super-spinatus testing. We do one examination for the biceps tendon. We have the patient's arm come up like this, and we put our finger right in here, and we have them do resistance this way. If they have paining anteriorly, especially if",

So you're getting some of the rotation of the rolling, but you're still going out to the side with the band. So I would do more just kind of rolling out like this now. And if you've seen some of my other exercises, this would be like a hook line when I'm lying down, doing like hip abduction and hook line, but you're doing it seated in a chair. So again, you're still working all these leg muscles, but now you're using the band to get yourself a little bit more resistance into it. And again, if you haven't done this before, you probably want to start off with just fire a 10 with the lightest band, then if you get to 20, 25, and it's easy, then you can go up to a higher resistive band. So now I'm going to bring it back down to the feet, and now we're going to do a hip internal rotation with a resistive band. And this one is a little bit tougher for people. The hip internal rotation is a little more uncomfortable, so just make sure you're ready to do this. But again, now this is a rotation, so I'm not doing",

From there I'm going to turn my leg in like this to the point where my knee is going to be at 90 degrees. My whole leg is flush against the floor. The other leg can just go straight. When you do this also you want your leg right here the top portion to be in line with the band so don't go at an angle make sure it's nice and straight. You're already going to feel a great pulling motion being built into the hip. What I want to do is use my body way to scoop back even more. With this position we're focusing a little bit more on internal rotation of the hip. So really focus on trying to scoop back as much as you can and allow this band to stretch that hip out. I feel a really good amount right here. So you can hold this for an extended period of time. You can do it for 30 seconds.

Do about 20 to 30 reps of this, this creates a lot of movement in the cervical spine. Once you feel comfortable and there's no pain when you do these exercises anymore, what you can do is basically use a resistant band and that will definitely accentuate the cervical loadosis a lot better. Make sure you get a resistant band that's about 20 to 30 pounds of resistance and you can get these at any sporting goods store. But to add traction, all you need to do is put the resistive band behind your neck and add a little bit of resistance and pulling it forward. This way there is a bit of force that pushes from the back of the neck to the front of the neck. Once this is easy and not painful for you, go from side to side and then once that's easy, go diagonally. About 20 to 30 reps, three sets once again. After a while using the resistive band against your neck, it might hurt because the robot in the resistive band might be cutting into the neck. can do is copy your neck with a towel first and then add a bit of a comfort for yourself.

Okay, so there you go. You guys on the internal and external rotation exercises. What I'll do is I'll do a set of 10 external and then I set a 10 internal and then repeat that three times. So three by 10 on your internal and external rotation exercises. And so that's it, you guys. That's shoulder impingement in a very brief video. What we need to work on is we want to work on posture and we want to work on the strength of that rotator calf.

      "answer": "To relieve leg pain through external rotation of the hip using a resistance band, you can perform a specific exercise that incorporates this movement. Begin by positioning yourself as if you are about to cross your leg into a figure-four position. As you lift your leg, focus on rotating your hip externally, which involves bringing your foot up while maintaining that rotational motion [Video 1: CWVEVBOGNE8, Time: 03:18-03:26].\n\nIncorporating a resistance band enhances the effectiveness of this exercise. As you perform the figure-four motion with the band, you will experience added resistance, which helps strengthen the hip muscles involved in external rotation. It's important to note that you do not need to lift your leg as high as demonstrated; the key is to achieve the correct rotation while using the band for resistance [Video 1: CWVEVBOGNE8, Time: 06:50-06:56].\n\nIn summary, using a resistance band during external rotation exercises can help alleviate leg pain by strengthening the hip muscles and improving mobility.

It's caused by a failure in the circulation, which means that your heart and brain don't have enough circulating the oxygenated blood. It could be due to heart attack, it could be due to an acute allergic reaction, it could be due to a major bleed or all sorts of other reasons that can cause that blood pressure to drop and plummet. If shock is untreated, it can lead to death, so it's a very serious and you need to recognise the signs quickly. The person might be pale, cold, clammy, feeling sick, feeling thirsty, that's all caused because when the body hasn't got enough circulating blood, the body tries to compensate. So your blood vessels can discreet so that they will get the blood to the vital organs. So you could pay a cold and it's a clammy because you don't have as much circulating blood to your skin. You feel sick and thirsty because you don't need all the blood supply to your gut. So draws it away and it's trying to get the blood to your heart and your brain. So imagine that this gentleman has had a major bleed, what you'd be doing is applying pressure really really quickly. So you'd be applying pressure like that. You would be applying a lot of pressure. You'd be having a look and seeing if there's anything in there, but we'll cover all that when we deal with bleeding in a separate video. Okay,",

The interesting thing about that is that everybody who dies eventually dies from some form of Shack. So when we're talking about emergency first aid, it's one of the things we'll always be watching for, along with airway breathing, circulation, bleeding control, right after we get into that circulation aspect we think about shock symptoms. Shack is sometimes misunderstood as shock like psychogenic shock, or psychologically emotional shock like scared or surprise, but that's not the kind of shock we're talking about. We're talking about one of the many forms of shock, forms meaning we could have spinal shock caused secondary to a spinal cord injury. Cardiogenic shock, primarily from punk failure, hypovalemic shock from loss of fluids or blood, and a philactic shock, which is primarily caused from a severe alerted reaction. And those are the main types of shock we'll see out in the environment. The symptoms are pretty much going to be about the same though, decreased level of consciousness, anxiety, chilled and cold, pale, clammy, poor capillary refill, you pinch the nail bed, usually takes two to three seconds to refill if it takes more than that, we're probably showing a delay in capillary refill, which could be an early sign of shock. The rapid breathing rapid pulse signs of shock, many times we don't know the reason why either going into",

You lose the ability to tell where the knee has at its space and makes you more vulnerable to re-engineering it again. your balance is going to be off. You might fall down, you wouldn't expect it. So you, again, I want to surgery. Now, let's say you tore your ACL or PCL along with the MCL. Well, in that case, they're recommending that you do have the MCL. I mean, the ACL repaired, but you still leave the MCL alone because they make where money I need. Yeah, right. Now, the ACL does provide some of that stability that the MCL does. Right. So it needs to be repaired. Otherwise, There's going to be too much stress on the MCL guys. Two out of the four legaments gone. Yeah, it's too much. It's just too much. So you're going to want to go ahead and have that repaired. Now, what about an MCL? All right, the ACL. So that's the big one that happens quite often. By the way, I got numbers on the way this spread. 150,000 new ACL tears a year.",

I first learned about it from Dr. Michael Sandal, who's at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Australia. And he showed me how distal finger tip injuries when utilizing this dressing actually heal as well, if not better, than some of the fancy flaps I was using to repair these pulp and tip defects on the finger. I wanna show you how I put the dressing on someone and I'll use a little simulated injury. And then I want to show you a couple of cases of volur pulp injury as well as distal tip injuries that actually heal up really well. If you have any questions about the IV 3000 protocol, visit our website mtpsa.com and you'll see the protocol as to how we do it. And then we always welcome your comments or questions. And thanks so much for watching. Here I've used red marker to simulate a volur pulp injury. and I'll show you how to put the dressing on, so I used the IV 3000 dressing by Smith and nephew because of its semi-porous capability it makes a nice one dressing. I go ahead and take off the covering, I have the patient lift their finger up and place it down. I do not take it proximal to the the PIP joint, and this will enable the patient to move their finger afterward. So",

The whole point of the walking boot is that it will stop the tendons to your toes from crossing your ankle and firing there, because all these tendons start on the leg. And at first people seem like it's crazy to wear a boot, but when they're not getting better for weeks or months, and their toes are still aching without relief, that's when this makes sense. If you want this to heal as quick as possible, you want to get yourself a walking boot, and you want to heal as quickly as possible. So this is reserved for people who aren't getting better or have a major toe fracture that's worse than it seems. So there's a lot of evidence behind stopping the tendons crossing your ankle, and that's the point of the walking boot. Sergical shoes good, but if you're doing a surgical shoe, you might as well just get a great shoe like this with a stiff insert. So this one has a stiff insert. See how it can't really bend? I can't bend, that's as hard as I'm pushing. And the fifth toe right here, you can see there's a mesh where the fifth toe is. So there's some links, but that's called a carbon fiber insert. They're like 50 bucks. It's an alternative if you can't wear a walking boot, but otherwise a walking boot will help you heal the quickest. If that's not working,",

So what we're going to do is cross fiber friction massage. You're going to find the spot here in the right off the bone, and you're going to move a little bit more towards the hand as soon as you need the spot where you're going to do this. And you're going to take one finger, two fingers, and you're going to go across the fibers. The fibers and the muscles go this way, so we're going to take into my side and go this way. And what this does, because a lot of times, is happened over time, is that scar tissue has formed in that tendon, or even a little bit in the muscle Brad, and that scar tissue is very weak, and it breaks open very easily. So, what happens is it starts to heal and you think, oh, it's getting better, and then you use it and it breaks open and you start to all over again, sure. So, this helps it heal strong, so like this, instead of like a cobweb, right?",

There's dozens of types of calf stretches out there so you can look them up on YouTube or Google. Now, I'll recommend doing this exercise with your shoes off of that way. You can actually feel the ground and use a bit of proprioception and train your body to feel where your body is. Just a moment of tip for you guys to open up the joints. So put this arm straight through the inner part of your knee towards that outside of your foot. Put your foot down, press your elbow into your knee and open up your chest. Try to sit upright and open up your hips a lot more. Just a moment of tip when you guys do as well is actually leaning different angles in this position. So what I want you to do is actually lean to side to side, so let's say on lean to 45 degrees, all we're there for about 10 to 30 seconds, and then go to the other side as well. And then go to more on a horizontal plane, and hold there for up 20 to 30 seconds as well. And then go to the other side for now that way you'll open up a lot of your joints and stretch a lot of the muscles that don't really get stretched in weight",

Deb Rocks is basically hydrogen peroxide and it's something that many of us use in our offices for example if I have a patient who has difficult wax to remove I'll either put hydrogen peroxide or mineral oil in the patient's ear to soften the wax to make it easier to either flush out or suction out. For people that do tend to build wax There are kids that you can buy. These things are readily available over the counter. My only advice is to proceed with caution. If you're searching for ear cleaning kits, you'll also probably see a variety of spray bottles with attachments meant for ear regation. I'm sorry about that one. Certainly there are times that I'll have my nurse irrigate some of the disease ear in the office. I just again also caution because the angle of the canal canal could be different for different people. Also, if the ear feels clogged and it's not a wax problem, then you go flushing water into the ear, you need to be mindful and be careful. Again, there's certainly a risk to rupture the ear drum, so we just want to be mindful of that, so I always tell patients to be gentle and if you feel pain, obviously you need to stop, putting anything in the ear, you can scratch the ear canal and that can cause bleeding. And then, of course, you get a scab, but now",

Mix one tablespoon of antiseptic mouthwash with three tablespoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. The gargle this mixture for a couple of minutes and follow it out with clean water. Hydrogen peroxide has an additional benefit of being a teeth whitener. You can use it as such in two ways, either as a rinse or as a paste. In the second case, mix it with two teaspoons of baking soda and leave the resulting concoction on your teeth for two to three minutes. After that, rinse the paste off with water. 5. Coconut Oil Another thing you can reach for in your kitchen cupboard is coconut oil. In a popular procedure called oil pulling, the coconut oil absorbs dirt in the mouth, reduces tartar and plaque, and helps you get rid of bad breath. On top of that, it also has an antibacterial effect against all the microorganisms that have decided to call your mouth their home. Switch one or two tablespoons of coconut oil around in your mouth for 10-15 minutes. Don't worry, it tastes great. and spit it out and rinse well with warm water.

Obviously, not walk around with a cute tip sticking out of your ear, because people can forget. And if you are a wax builder, if you tend to build up a lot of earwax, you should not use them, because all you're going to do is act for wax in further. Another much discussed yet controversial technique is called ear-candling. Ear-candling involves placing hollow candles in the ear and lighting them. proponents of the technique say it warms up earwax and creates a vacuum that pulls it out of the ear. However, numerous medical studies cast down on these claims and the FDA has warned consumers to steer clear of products being labeled as ear candles. I see people that fail the candle that have, for example, wax left behind from ear candle. Now, when you search for ear cleaning kids online, Deb Rocks often comes up and claims to be quote number one doctor and pharmacist recommended.

You can use them against hair loss, for wound healing, preventing bug bites, treating frost bite, and, of course, removing tartar. They act as a natural scrub that both polishes and clean your teeth. All you've got to do is chew on one full tablespoon of seeds. Now, you want to create a kind of piecing your mouth without swallowing it in the process. After you've successfully completed this challenge, take a dry toothbrush and brush your teeth with paste. You can use this method twice a week. An additional benefit of sesame seeds is their ability to lower the number of Strap-to-Coccus bacteria in your mouth. That is that nasty, highly contagious strand of bacteria that gives you Strap throat. Number six, hydrogen peroxide and mouthwash.

And what we're going to do is you're going to clean both sides. You're going to clean where we're going to drain, but you want to clean everything. You want to clean the fingers, you want to have gloves on like I do, you want to get the back, you want to get the front, and you want to figure out exactly where you're going to sort of make your site for aspirating this fluid out. And so once we have that done, we can move on, so it's pretty much clean and ready to go. There you go. So we bypass the draining of this year, so we're going to go over giving a dust and instruction I don't actually what to do in the morning and at night.

First, how do you clean it? Eyes are swollen shut. You want to just be as gentle as possible, of course, with newborn skin. So just some cotton tips, you know, some little cute tips, little cotton balls, what with warm water and just really gently clean the eyelids open a little washcloth as fine too. Then the most important thing that you can do is something called crygler massage. And what crygler massage is, is it's a way of increasing the pressure in the nasal lateral system, you know, where your tears drain in this inner corner. There's a little hole in the top and bottom called the punta. And they go down into your nose and that's where your tears drain. So that's why you get a runny nose when you cry. So in these babies, they've got that little, like, a blocked tearduct is all it is like a clogged dream. So the tears are overflowing, like a clogged dream through the front. So we want to open up that passageway and the massage, but actually doing it properly creates this pressure that kind of sucks everything in and helps open the passageway up. So you want to do it three types a day, five times each time. So what you're doing is you're going to push right in the inner corner of the nose",

So the simple solution to this problem is actually getting air to go through our your station tube into our middle ear space to regulate that pressure. Under normal circumstances, our ears will naturally unclog just by swallowing, but when swallowing isn't enough, you need to use a trick in order to get air through your you station tube into your middle ear space and the first one is called the Valsalva maneuver. Very simply the Valsalva maneuver is when you plug your nose and blow. That'll take air push it through your station tube into your middle ear space and it will regulate that pressure. If the Valsalva maneuver isn't getting the job done, then you may have to use our second technique which is the Lowry method. With the Lowry method, you basically do the same steps as you would with the Valsalva maneuver, but instead of just plugging your nose and blowing, you're plugging your nose blowing and swallowing at the same time, that sometimes gets extra air through your station tube and into your middle ear space. If you're not capable of doing those first two techniques, then the third technique is yawning, because when you yawning, it opens up those your station tubes just enough to let some air through.

So one of the things is a lot of times the depending Depending on how long it's been an issue, a lot of times are using syringes, a lot of docks we use syringes that are very, very wide in diameter, this is a very wide millimeter. It's not necessary if this is four days, we don't need that. We can actually get away with four days, we can get away with a little diabetic syringes. Very, very small needle, not painful at all. It should move the fluid out of this high volume like we have. We may use two or three of these, but it shouldn't be a huge deal. So it's not going to be a big deal for you. We'll use it until we're done. And if it's a massive hematome on the ear, then we use something with a similar gauge, which is longer, but you have more volume to pull the fluid in. So we're going to start with that and take care of the ear and we'll go from there. OK, so what we're going to do now is we're going to just sort of prepped the ear for draining. And what",

To use an ear thermometer, gain consent from the individual. Make sure that the thermometer is clean. Place a new clean disposable tip on the end of the probe. Gently pull the ear back and insert the probe into the ear canal. The ear canal points slightly downwards and to the face. The reading may not be accurate if the probe isn't fully inserted into the ear. Squeeze and hold down the button for one second. Remove the thermometer and read the temperature. Record the temperature reading on the paper news chart or an electronic device. through the disposable tip away. Other types of thermometers include digital thermometers and strip type thermometers. Strip type thermometers are not recommended as they measure the temperature of the skin and not the core body temperature.

So, right in the back, hey, if we can and you have a very accommodating patient like Paul is doing here, you can try going above the muscles which we recommend. Now you have your swab, what you will take you to do is put the swab, there are little indentations right in the center, you will put the swab inside and you will rotate it three times. The swab will stay and then you want to leave that sitting there for a minute. So I'm going to put my little timer on on a minute. At the end of a minute, you will rotate again three times one two three you just discard the swab and what you want to do the solution that you put in here will need to go down into this hole that is right here so once you've put it into the solution and you look down the inside of this should be dry. If you're not sure it's okay, you can do it again. Now as you see, the solution is starting to go up. You now want to time this for 15 minutes.

When a patient comes to see me, what they refer by a primary care is that they don't know how to use their nasal spray correctly. And when you don't use a nasal spray correctly, just bring up into your nose. You're going to be spraying your septum or your nasal bone here, the side effects of using an ASL spray is actually bleeding, so that's because they were using it incorrectly. So what is the correct way to use nasal spray so you get allergy relief without the bleeding? So you have to shake it, make sure it comes out and you're going to tell your head down like this. And what happens is most people will ople like this and that's just going to actually just spray your bone in the nose here. You actually want to aim towards the ear like this. Spray, snore slowly, shake it again, aim towards the ear, spray, snore slowly. For The Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Ian Roth.",

You need an alcohol swab or if you're at home and you don't have any alcohol swabs, you can use your bottle of alcohol with a cotton ball. You will need the syringe, and you of course need your vitamin B12 with the physician called in for you, and the physician probably would have called in your syringe with your needle's awesome. With my patient population, I do prefer the smaller needle, which is a 25-gay-to-one it's needle, and actually that is the size of needle that they use to give you your seasonal flu shot. So for all of you that have needle phobia, it is okay to use a smaller needle. You also, at how I'm going to use my little skin pad, but you can also practice on it orange, or any kind of fruit, a lemon, would work, even an apple. I like the orange and the lemons, because they're softer and that's more like skin-like feeling. So what you'll do is go ahead and just open your alcohol swab and get it ready, or get your cotton bar ready. I'm going to go ahead and take out the syringe and all of the syringes that you use will always have numbers on it. And the most common dose of vitamin",

You can use aquifer once the risk of infection is down, but for now we're using antibiotic and going to clean that off and we're going to take two of the medium discs.

So whatever method you choose be gentle and proceed at your own risk. If you want to skip ahead to hear about a specific product, I'll put some time stamps in the description. Now, let's get right into it with the controversial cotton swab. It's advised not to use them in general because cuttips can cause damage if they're pushed into far. But the lands that make wax tend to be in the outer third of the canal. And so typically when we, as ear nose and throat or even primary care, see wax that's been pushed down to the level of the ear drum, then we know that somebody's been using cuttips and pushing wax in. I've had two patients in my 22-year history of practicing answer the telephone with a Q-tip in their ear and cause significant trauma to the ear drum and the bones in the middle ear. The cotton tip could also come off and get lodged in your ear, which does not sound like fun. I will tell you personally, I used Q-tips. I use them on an almost daily basis. I'm ultra-careful when I use them, and it's just in general my advice, that if you do use them, you want to be careful. Obviously, not walk around with a cute tip sticking out of your ear, because people can",

If you're putting in the drops and wiggling at the ear and pumping the trages and the drops aren't going in, it might be because there's a bunch of wax or the skin's peeling off or the infections filling the ear with goo. If that's the case, then you might need to see your nose and throat doctor to get the ear cleaned out or suction so that the medicine can even get in. Most of the time ear drops shouldn't hurt, but if the ear is a little bit inflamed or if there's a scratch or scrape, or if there's an ear tube and the drops can get in further is sometimes can be a little bit uncomfortable. If the ear drops hurt, sometimes there are good alternatives or other options that you can switch to and other times you just have to tough it out but that's a discussion with your doctor. If you have ear tubes or if you possibly have a hole in the ear drum there's going to be a lot of drops that you're not supposed to use. There are only a few types of drops that we want going in that far so if you have concerns of a possible hole in the ear drum or if you have ear tubes make sure sure that you don't just",

So which is your better hearing ear? I'm all right. And have you got any pain or tenderness? No. And can I get you to give me a smile? By asking the patient to smile, you can look for facial weakness, which is one of the five cardinal symptoms of ear disease. The facial nerve runs in the medial wall of the middle ear and may be affected by pathology in the air. Alright, thank you. So I'm now going to start by examining the better hearing air. First inspect the external air using the light of the outer scope to help. Look at the colour of the skin and the shape of the pinner. Look for other abnormalities such as toe-fi and congenital defects. I remember to check the scars. Common surgical scars include the endoral scar between the root of the helix and the trages and the post-oricular scar behind the pinner. Next, otoscopy is performed to visualise the external auditory meatus and the timpanic membrane. There are two sizes of speckulum for the autoscope. Choose the largest size speckulum possible for the patient's ear canal in order to maximise the amount of light passing into the ear and to maximise your view of the timpanic membrane. And adults, the larger speculum, is usually used. When examining the right ear, hold the odiscoping your right hand. Hold it like",

A low-core body temperature might be related to being in a cold environment, but can also be caused by infections and certain conditions such as diabetes or thyroid disease. To take a temperature reading, you need to be familiar with the type of thermometer you have available. The most common type of thermometer is the ear thermometer as they are quick and easy to use. To use an ear thermometer, gain consent from the individual. Make sure that the thermometer is clean. Place a new clean disposable tip on the end of the probe. Gently pull the ear back and insert the probe into the ear canal. The ear canal points slightly downwards and to the face. The reading may not be accurate if the probe isn't fully inserted into the ear. Squeeze and hold down the button for one second. Remove the thermometer and read the temperature. Record the temperature reading on the paper news chart or an electronic device. through the disposable tip away. Other types of thermometers include digital thermometers and strip type thermometers. Strip type thermometers are not recommended as they measure the temperature of the skin and not the core body temperature. If you have any concerns about someone's temperature, please speak to a senior colleague.",

So which is your better hearing ear? I'm all right. And have you got any pain or tenderness? No. And can I get you to give me a smile? By asking the patient to smile, you can look for facial weakness, which is one of the five cardinal symptoms of ear disease. The facial nerve runs in the medial wall of the middle ear and may be affected by pathology in the air. Alright, thank you. So I'm now going to start by examining the better hearing air. First inspect the external air using the light of the outer scope to help. Look at the colour of the skin and the shape of the pinner. Look for other abnormalities such as toe-fi and congenital defects. I remember to check the scars. Common surgical scars include the endoral scar between the root of the helix and the trages and the post-oricular scar behind the pinner. Next, otoscopy is performed to visualise the external auditory meatus and the timpanic membrane. There are two sizes of speckulum for the autoscope. Choose the largest size speckulum possible for the patient's ear canal in order to maximise the amount of light passing into the ear and to maximise your view of the timpanic membrane. And adults, the larger speculum, is usually used. When examining the right ear, hold the odiscoping your right hand. Hold it like",

So just some cotton tips, you know, some little cute tips, little cotton balls, what with warm water and just really gently clean the eyelids open a little washcloth as fine too. Then the most important thing that you can do is something called crygler massage. And what crygler massage is, is it's a way of increasing the pressure in the nasal lateral system, you know, where your tears drain in this inner corner. There's a little hole in the top and bottom called the punta. And they go down into your nose and that's where your tears drain. So that's why you get a runny nose when you cry. So in these babies, they've got that little, like, a blocked tearduct is all it is like a clogged dream. So the tears are overflowing, like a clogged dream through the front. So we want to open up that passageway and the massage, but actually doing it properly creates this pressure that kind of sucks everything in and helps open the passageway up. So you want to do it three types a day, five times each time. So what you're doing is you're going to push right in the inner corner of the nose",

Most of the time ear drops shouldn't hurt, but if the ear is a little bit inflamed or if there's a scratch or scrape, or if there's an ear tube and the drops can get in further is sometimes can be a little bit uncomfortable. If the ear drops hurt, sometimes there are good alternatives or other options that you can switch to and other times you just have to tough it out but that's a discussion with your doctor. If you have ear tubes or if you possibly have a hole in the ear drum there's going to be a lot of drops that you're not supposed to use.

And this video is part of a complete series all about eye drops, whether you're looking for the best eyedrops for dry eyes, red eyes or itchy eyes, if you want to check out the full series, I'll put a link to that in the video description below so you can find it easily. Now let's go over how to apply eyedrops easily and without missing. Step 1 is to always wash your hands, you can be touching around your eyes and you won't possibly give yourself an infection. Step 2 is to check the side of the bottle or the box for an expiration date. If it is expired then it's best not to use it otherwise the active ingredients aren't going to be working and you end up just getting more side effects and possibly cause a burn or irritation to the eye. The three is going to be shaking the bottle for about 10 seconds. That's going to mix around the ingredients and improve the effectiveness of many eyebrow medications. Now, step four is to remove the cap of the bottle and place the cap on a clean surface such as a clean tissue paper or paper towel. Some place where it's not going to contaminate the top. Plus a pro tip here is to observe the tip of the bottle for any coloration change because that could be a sign of contamination and you don't want to be using those drops. Now, step five here is going to",

Hi guys, Cliff Olsen, Dr. Vodiology, and founder of Applied Hearing Solutions in Anthem, Arizona. And on this channel, I cover a bunch of hearing related information to help make you a better informed consumer. So if you're into that, consider hitting the subscribe button. Our ears can get plugged up for a variety of reasons. One of those is changing elevation, Whether you're driving in a car through the mountains or you're on an airplane, ascending or descending, you can get the sensation that your ears are being plugged up. Another reason your ears would feel clogged is if you are having a cold or a sinus infection and you have a bunch of mucus that is plugging up your sinuses. So what is actually giving you the sensation that your ears are clogged? Our ears are comprised of an outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. Our middle ear is connected to our throat by our use station tube. This tube is responsible for keeping the air pressure in our middle ear equal with the air pressure in our outer ear. If the use station tube does not keep things equal, we get this perception that our ears are clogged. So the simple solution to this problem is actually getting air to go through our your station tube into our middle ear space to regulate that pressure. Under normal circumstances, our ears will naturally unclog",

And when you class them, I want you to push into that neck and squeeze that neck as you class. Go ahead and squeeze it. Now what I want you to do, I want you to take your chin and bring your chin to your chest as you continue to squeeze those muscles. And you'll feel those muscles kind of release, and you'll hold it there, about 30 seconds. As you take deep breaths and blow it out, keep squeezing as you let your chin fall on your chest, beautiful. And you'll feel those deep muscles start to release, you'll hold that about 30 seconds. That's a great exercise. We're targeting different muscles behind the neck that attach behind the head That's going to release to give you a lot of relief. The last one I like you to do are chin tucks and shoulder blade squeezes together. The chin tuck, you're going to keep your chin neutral with the floor, do not flex your head forward or backwards. And what you're going to do is you're going to tuck your chin in just like this from the side. As if you have a double chin, okay, you go forward and",

Same thing, hold the stretch for 10 seconds, 10 repetitions and do three sets. Now three exercises, three strengthening exercises you can do there will also relieve tension and pain in your neck. The first one is a cervical retraction, again, you're trying to activate those deep muscles in your neck. So what you do is you keep your eyes to be horizon, tuck your chin in, hold this for about two seconds and release, 10 to 10 repetitions repeat this three or four times a day. But you need to do this a few times to get some relief, so make sure you show those nice and down, the chin in, they were created double chin, hold up for 8 times seconds, and relax again, yeah? So this exercise number one, you can do simple exercise with very effective, exercise number two, if this doesn't help and again you need to try to do it a few times, if this doesn't help do the same thing but then laying down, laying on your back.

So a lot of times people will just do a chin tuck by ducking their head down kind of tucking their chin down into their chest. We're not nodding, we're not going up and down. rather we're going straight back is the motion that you should look for. With this, we're gonna get a good stretch kind of right here at the base of the skull. These muscles are called your sub-occipital muscles. We get a good stretch there. We get a good elongation here. And it's a great way that we can stretch those muscles and train your posture, train your head to kind of sit back over your shoulders where we need it to be. That's another way. Follow what it is. Go ahead. What is it? Double chin. The double chin exercise. Okay. Next, I'm going to grab this foam roll, these foam rolls, we're on this all the time.

Take a look at this from another view, again, I'm pulling up there, deep stretch that is a area that is usually tied on people with that type of head posture. These stretches can be held for about 10 seconds, and you can do a few sets of those. I recommend at least two, maybe even three sets, again, hold it for about 10 seconds. Alright, and this next stretch here, we're going to stretch more of this side in the front of the neck, usually in area that's tight, that's kind of what pulls that head forward. So we really want to get into the side in the front of the neck. You'll notice my shoulders back. I'm gently reaching around with the other hand and pulling towards the other side.

          "text": "Welcome back guys. Today I'm going to show you some neck stretches and exercises to restore the natural neck curve, also known as the cervical load doses. Now we tend to have a reduction of cervical load doses, especially if we have to lean forward and do daily tasks. For example, working at a desk on a laptop or fracture work where we have the position on head forward and working front of us. This position can cause a lot of stress and strain in this area and cause crushing of the nerves that go down and go down the neck into the shoulder and into the arm, causing a lot of referral pain. So if you do have pain in the wrist, pain in the arm, pain in the shoulder or pain in the neck, these stretches will definitely help you help and restore that neck curve, especially also reduce headaches and migraines as well, because a lot of stress and strain can cause tightness in the neck and back up into the head as well. Try out these neck stretches and exercises out I reckon they're definitely going to help you out. Passive towel mobilizations with rotation. Place a hand towel around your neck, now cross the towel over and grab both ends of the towel with your hands. And with one end of the towel, raise it so it presses up against one of the sides of your jaw. Make sure your neck is nice and relaxed and there is no resistance and",

In this exercise, turn your head towards one side, keeping your chin at the same height and moving within comfortable limits. Now gently tense your neck muscles and hold for five seconds, then return your head to the center and repeat on the opposite side. Once again, you need to try and repeat this five times on each side. And lastly, we have the neck stretch. So keeping the rest of the body straight, push your chin forward so your throat is stretched. Now gently tense your neck muscles and hold for five seconds. Then, return your head to the center and push it backwards, keeping your chin up. you also need to hold this for five seconds, repeat this exercise for five times. So as I mentioned at the start of the video, most cases of neck pain that causes unclear and we call that non-specific neck pain. So for non-specific neck pain, these exercises should help ease the pain within two weeks and hopefully after four to six weeks, you should be fully recovered. Now please remember, try and do these exercises for six to eight weeks in total and this will help strengthen the area two and hopefully prevent a neck pain from and come in back. Now please remember that if you symptoms aren't improving then you should definitely make an appointment to speak to your health care professional, I explained it",

You'll see how my upper back rounds forward, and then my neck right here has to really extend so we call that upper cervical extension. So I'm down here but I'm looking up like this that puts a ton of stress in that area. So we want to get out of that and then we want to get the chin and the head back in the right in the normal position. And so these exercises that I'm going to show you are geared towards those things. Okay now we're going to jump into them. All right so exercise number one that we're going to do are called chin pucks. Basically what I want you to do is light out flat on your back with your head flat. There's no pillow underneath my head right now. And then what I want you to do is try to tuck your chin down into your throat. Basically the motion we're trying to promote here is called upper cervical rotation. And so it looks just like that. Hold for three, two, three, and then come right back up. Chin tuck down and hold one, two, three, and then come right back up. The goal here is to activate those deep neck flexors is going to help to pull that head back to",

This provides support and helps you maintain proper posture during the exercise [Video 1: yPm8Fftp4Dk, Time: 04:11-04:13].\n\n3. **Chin Tuck Movement**: Gently tuck your chin towards your chest. Imagine creating a double chin; this movement should be subtle and controlled. Avoid pushing your head forward or backward.\n\n4. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this position for a few seconds, focusing on the stretch and alignment of your neck. \n\n5. **Repetition**: Repeat the chin tuck for several repetitions, ensuring you breathe normally throughout the exercise.\n\n**Safety Notes**: If you experience any discomfort, such as sharp pain or excessive clicking, stop the exercise. It's normal to feel some gentle clicking or cracking, but avoid forcing any movements [Video 1]. \n\nThis exercise can help improve neck posture and alleviate tension in the neck muscles.",
