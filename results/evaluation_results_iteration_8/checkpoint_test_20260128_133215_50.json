That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out.

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

So before you do this scalp massage, let's check the condition of your scalp. Feel the scalp if there's any tightness or painful spot or any discomfort. And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter.

So, use my fingers and any part never use the fingernails, okay? Relax your shoulders, breathe out, and then clasherly apply firm pressure. And then, who's your fingers up to the top of your head?

So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms,",

      "answer": "To perform chin tucks effectively for neck pain relief, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Preparation**: Begin by finding a comfortable position, either sitting or standing. Ensure your back is straight and shoulders are relaxed.\n\n2. **Chin Tuck Execution**: Gently pull your chin straight back towards your neck, as if you are trying to create a double chin. Avoid tilting your head up or down; the movement should be horizontal. This action helps to strengthen the muscles at the base of your neck and improve posture [Video 3: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 08:19-08:22].\n\n3. **Resistance**: For enhanced effectiveness, you can use a resistance band (taraband) around your forehead while performing the chin tuck. This added resistance can help achieve quicker results [Video 3].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10-15 repetitions, holding each tuck for a few seconds. \n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: If you experience increased pain or discomfort during the exercise, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. It\u2019s important to listen to your body and avoid overexertion [Video 1]. \n\nIncorporating these chin t",

That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out.

Squeeze your shoulder blades together and back. The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder",

Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

You also feel it kind of going down into the shoulder blade. So you can kind of see here this muscle here, the levator scape kind of comes off the vertebrae and comes down out to the shoulder blade. So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out.

Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past",

So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades. And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one out is this one's going to be a little bit differently so again you're going to use your arm but this time is going to go up so you can either just raise your arm or I like to kind of put it back this way where my elbows",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

Place your forearms on each wall at shoulder height, ensuring your elbows are slightly below shoulder level.\n\n2. **Stretching**: Lean your body forward into the corner while keeping your forearms on the walls. This action will stretch the muscles in your neck and shoulders. As you lean, turn your head away from the side where you feel pain. For example, if your neck pain is on the right side, turn your head to the left to create a stretch on the right side of your neck [Video 1: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\n3. **Hold the Stretch**: Maintain this position for 15-30 seconds, feeling the stretch in the neck and shoulder area. Repeat this several times, ensuring you do not push into pain.\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Always listen to your body. If you experience sharp pain or discomfort, ease out of the stretch. It's also advisable to incorporate heat or ice as needed, and consider taking over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen if",

Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it, but that's where your problem comes from AC joint. It could also also be a bit of osteoarthritis, you need to be really a bit older for that, maybe having had a drum and a past in your shoulder, a lot of grinding goes on, I'm not talking about the occasional clicking when you move your arm, but it's the grinding stuff, that is",

If it does it's an infraspanator's tear in the causing your shoulder problem. Another structure which might cause you an issue is the AC joint and the AC joint is located on top of your shoulder. So you go, if you come up from your upper arm, you feel like a hard structure, a boner bit and you go in about half an inch and you feel a little bit of a dip and that's the AC joint. That's commonly affected with people who push weights, weightlifting stuff especially with shoulder presses and up and down. And also, we see a lot of traumatic events, for example, with cyclists when they land, when they fall of the bike and they land on the shoulder, you often see here, but almost like a step defect, like your shoulder is a bit lower than your clavicle. That's the AC joint here. So the test you can do to determine if your pain is actually caused by the AC joint is the pull of part test. And what you do is you interlock your fingers, and you literally just pull apart as hard as you can. Now, and if you get a little bit of an egg, top of your shoulder, it's problem AC joint, something can be done about it, it can help you with it,",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this.

Have someone assist you with the application, as the brace is adjustable only in the back, which is crucial for proper stabilization and to prevent further injury [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 01:05-01:09]. Position the felt back pad behind your shoulder blades, ensuring the plastic triangle points downward. Then, carefully wrap the left strap over your left shoulder and under your armpit, securing it in place [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 01:21-01:26]. \n\nThe brace features a figure-eight design that helps keep your shoulders back, stabilizing the clavicle area for optimal healing after a fracture [Video 1: UZqktEPlxTU, Time: 00:46-00:49]. It is important to have assistance during this process to ensure the brace is applied correctly and to avoid any additional strain on the injured area. In summary, proper application of the clavicle brace involves careful positioning and assistance for effective stabilization and healing.",

And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar",

We know how L5 was down at the top of your foot if you feel symptoms there, right? So where you're having the pain, it could be where you're having the pinched nerve but quite often it isn't. It's a real, it's a real treasure hunt here kind of trying to kind of investigate of the job trying to figure out where the problem is coming from.

This is really where the partial head here. These are the bones that stack up to make your back, you know, within the bones itself there's a canal and that's your spinal cord and coming off the spinal cord are these nerves All right, these are the nerves that can get compressed or pinched, all right?

Obtain adequate consent for the examination, as this is crucial for patient comfort and trust, especially since much of the examination occurs from behind the patient [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Position the patient comfortably, ideally sitting or standing, to allow access to the supraclavicular area.\n\n3. **Locating the Nodes**: Identify the supraclavicular fossa, which is located above the clavicle. This area is where the supraclavicular lymph nodes are situated [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:22-01:36].\n\n4. **Palpation**: Using your fingers, gently palpate both sides of the supraclavicular fossa. Feel deeply inside the fossa to assess for any enlarged or tender lymph nodes.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Note any findings, including size, consistency, and tenderness of the lymph nodes, as this information is vital for further evaluation.\n\nAlways",

In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar z-shaped. The pre-orical lymph nodes are located just down to the triggers of the ear and are examined. Whereas the post-orical lymph nodes are actually located behind the pinner and are examined. So, the final set of lymph nodes on the skull are the occipital lymph nodes and are located at the top of the neutral line where trapezius joins into the skull.",

This is particularly important with an examination of the lymph nodes, as the majority of the examination is done from behind the patient. Therefore, it is vital that the patient knows what you're about to do and where you wish placing your hands. To begin with, let's examine where the lymph nodes are positioned. In terms of assessing the supracovicular lymph nodes, they are, as the name would suggest, above the clavicle situated in the supracovicular fossa. And I'll felt we both sides feeling deeply inside the fossa. And the lymph nodes have been exaggerated and can be seen here. The submental lymph nodes are examined with direct pressure underneath the chin, as is seen here. As with all parts of the lymph node examination, both hands are used. You are feeling for a series of features on any potential masses or nodes found. The submental lymph nodes, previously examined, and now identified here in red, are separate from the sub-mandibular lymph nodes, which run along the length of the jaw, and, again, examined carefully with the fingers, bilatrally. The cervical lymph nodes are located in a z-shaped pattern on the side of the neck. They are deep to the sternoclider mastoid muscles and shallow to the scaling muscles. And they're examined with the flat to the fingers in this similar",

Introduce yourself to the patient and obtain their consent, as this is crucial for any examination, especially since much of the assessment is performed from behind the patient [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Have the patient in a comfortable position, ideally seated, to facilitate access to the submental area.\n\n3. **Locating the Nodes**: The submental lymph nodes are located beneath the chin, in the midline of the neck. Use your fingers to palpate gently in this area.\n\n4. **Palpation Technique**: With your fingers, apply gentle pressure to feel for any enlargement or tenderness of the lymph nodes. It is important to assess both sides for comparison, even though the focus is on the submental region.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Note any findings, such as size, consistency, and tenderness, which are essential for further evaluation.\n\nAlways ensure the patient is comfortable throughout the examination [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: ",

I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the",

You can see on this diagram behind me and I'll use my swab as a pointer that you're actually going horizontally. You're not going vertically. You don't want to insert this right up into the nose like you would normally think the nasal passages are going To get under the inferior turbinates, you're actually going to start at the very base of the nose in this little flesh area and you're going to go gently over that skin and you will feel this swab slide right into this area. If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all. And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

And when it gets just right here, and also the back of my neck right here, that's where I feel a lot of pain, tension, and I feel my scalp get tighter.

If you do it correctly like this, this swab slides straight in. It's a minimal discomfort to the patient and they'll feel more of a tickling type sensation. sometimes I'm just a little bit of teary in the eye on that side. But this is not painful at all. And you notice that the key is that this wall of this horizontal not vertically tilted is on showing here. And that's the key. So I'm going to go through a couple steps and show you exactly how this is done. I also want to tell you that this far is protected where and gear. Some people will deck out in everything including a gown, gloves, mask. I sheelts, typically in my setting the respiratory therapist, text, doctor's nurses. We all just put all the pair of gloves. If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face",

Introduce yourself to the patient and obtain consent for the examination, as this is crucial for patient comfort and trust [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Have the patient seated comfortably, ideally with their back to you, as much of the examination will be performed from behind [Video 2].\n\n3. **Locating the Nodes**: The preauricular lymph nodes are located just in front of the ear, while the postauricular nodes are situated behind the ear. Use your fingers to palpate gently in these areas, feeling for any swelling or tenderness.\n\n4. **Examination Technique**: Apply gentle pressure with your fingertips to assess for any abnormalities. It\u2019s important to communicate with the patient throughout the process to ensure they are comfortable and to inform them of what you are doing [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:22-01:36].\n\n5. **Documentation**: After the examination, document your",

Obtain adequate consent for the examination, as this is crucial for patient comfort and trust [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n2. **Positioning**: Position the patient comfortably, ideally seated. Since the examination of lymph nodes is often performed from behind the patient, ensure they are aware of your actions and where you will place your hands [Video 2: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 00:51-00:56].\n\n3. **Locating the Nodes**: The occipital lymph nodes are located at the back of the head, just above the nape of the neck. Use your fingers to palpate this area gently, feeling for any enlargement or tenderness [Video 1: _N89T_Yqu68, Time: 01:22-01:36].\n\n4. **Assessment**: Assess both sides for symmetry and any abnormalities. Document your findings and ensure to communicate with the patient throughout the examination to maintain their comfort.\n\nAlways remember",

It happens because when you fall asleep, the muscles in your throat, they relax, and with open mouth breathing, it starts to get these vibrations, and you know, it can be like, my dad was just as a chainsaw, you know? All right. How many cords would you cut last night, dad? Yeah, I had a friend that stayed in our cabin. It was, it was unreal. It was a phenomena. I mean, did you hand out your plugs? Oh, I mean, I had door shut, and you could hear him. I mean, Yeah, I mean, I think the towel is complaining. Yeah, we don't want to talk about it, right? So I would make the news.

And the lower traps here actually pull the shoulders back and down. So these top muscles, the upper traps work against the lower traps. So you can see the solution of the permanent solution to this problem is to strengthen the middle and lower traps so that they can oppose these upper traps. So we're going to be working at these muscles here working down and back encounter acting, these muscles pulling up too tightly. So let me show you the exercises to actually permanently fix this problem. Okay so as I said at the answer you can do these exercises at home or in the gym you don't even need any equipment.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade.

Now can you try that at home or wherever you are? Head down, pull the shoulders away from your ears and then actually start to activate those lower trapezius muscles I was showing you on the diagram for earlier. Now second step is pull your shoulders away from your ears, squeeze your shoulders together and lift your hands just off the ground and now lower them down slowly and relax.

      "answer": "To alleviate chronic neck tension while lying down, you can perform specific exercises that target the upper and lower trapezius muscles. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Lie down on your back on a flat surface. Ensure your head and neck are supported, possibly using a small pillow or rolled towel under your neck for comfort.\n\n2. **Stretching**: To stretch the upper trapezius, gently tilt your head to one side, bringing your ear toward your shoulder. Avoid bending your head forward or twisting it excessively. This helps to stretch the tight muscles without straining them [Video 3: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 03:21-03:25].\n\n3. **Strengthening**: Focus on strengthening the lower trapezius muscles. You can do this by performing exercises that involve pulling your shoulder blades down and back. This counteracts the tension caused by the upper traps [Video 1: PdMJAhD7NEw, Time: 02:14-02:18].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim for 10-15 repetitions of each stretch and strengthening exercise, ensuring you maintain proper form to avoid injury.\n\n5. **",

And when you move it, it actually puts pressure on it, because I increase pain. sometimes I've got people that have scarred tissue on a nerve in their back. We actually had to stretch that nerve to break up that scar tissue. After surgery, sometimes you can have scarred build up or an injury. So the other thing is, as the nurse come out, anywhere along this path, they can get pinched somewhere. And the common one that many of you probably know about is turtle tunnel syndrome. And there's a band, a ligament that goes across here, and the nerve crosses underneath that ligament. And especially if you allow repetitive activities like typing or if you're bending your wrist this way or this way actually type or that ligament can thicken up and it is less room for the nerve to go under and that's where you can get pinched nerve and also. So the job of the physician or doctor or physical therapist is to figure out where along this path or your arms, are you getting a pinched nerve or where along, you know, your legs.

Because that tells us possibly which nerve is actually being pinched. We know it's all mapped out where L3, the nerve coming out of L3, your number is spying where it goes down in your leg. We know how L5 was down at the top of your foot if you feel symptoms there, right? So where you're having the pain, it could be where you're having the pinched nerve but quite often it isn't.

Pinched nerves can cause discomfort in specific areas, such as the front or back of the arm, or inside or outside of the leg. This information is crucial as it helps determine which nerve may be affected [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 02:33-02:38].\n\n2. **Identify Symptoms**: Note any additional symptoms such as tingling, numbness, or weakness in the affected area. These symptoms can indicate nerve compression.\n\n3. **Map Symptoms to Nerve Roots**: Understand that different nerve roots correspond to specific areas of the body. For example, pain along the L3 nerve root may manifest in the leg, while L5 can affect the top of the foot. Recognizing these patterns can help pinpoint the affected nerve [Video 3: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 02:55-02:59].\n\n4. **Consult a Professional**: If you suspect a pinched nerve, consult a healthcare professional. They can perform a thorough examination and may recommend",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here.

The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your upper back is placed over the bed. So you want to go down as far as you're able to go, just letting gravity take it. From there what I do is wing my elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my head. This will create a passive stretch into the upper back, and if it is locked up, you may",

      "answer": "To identify if you may have Saturday night palsy, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Recognize Symptoms**: Saturday night palsy typically occurs when pressure is applied to the radial nerve, often from falling asleep in a position that compresses the nerve, such as resting your arm on a hard surface. If you wake up with an inability to move your arm, particularly the wrist or fingers, this could indicate radial nerve palsy [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\n2. **Assess Arm Position**: Consider the position you were in while sleeping. If you were leaning on your arm or resting it in an awkward position, this increases the likelihood of nerve compression.\n\n3. **Check for Movement**: Try to move your wrist and fingers. If you experience weakness or a complete inability to move them, this is a significant sign of Saturday night palsy.\n\n4. **Seek Medical Advice**: If you suspect you have Saturday night palsy, consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. They can determine if the symptoms are due to nerve compression or another issue.\n\nAlways be cautious about prolonged pressure on the arms to prevent nerve damage.",

So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here.

You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can.

The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here.

      "answer": "To identify if you may have honeymoon palsy, follow these steps based on the provided video evidence:\n\n1. **Recognize Symptoms**: The primary symptom of honeymoon palsy is the inability to move your arm, particularly if you wake up with a feeling of numbness or weakness. This condition often occurs when pressure is applied to the radial nerve, typically from sleeping in an awkward position, such as resting your arm on a hard surface like a bar or chair [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\n2. **Assess Positioning**: Consider your sleeping position. If you have been sleeping with your arm in a position that could cause nerve compression, such as bending or pinching, this could lead to symptoms of palsy [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:14-07:19].\n\n3. **Check for Nerve Compression**: If you experience tingling, weakness, or inability to move your arm after waking, it may indicate nerve compression. This can happen due to prolonged pressure on the nerve, which is a common cause of radial nerve palsy [Video 1:",

The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

The brace should now be in a figure 8 shape. To adjust Just the fit, the person helping to pull the straps tighter or loosen the straps until your desired level of clavicle or posture support is reached. Make sure they adjust one strap by time to prevent further injury. Once on and properly adjusted, you should feel your shoulders being gently pulled back.

This can lead to a condition known as radial nerve palsy, where you may find it difficult to move your arm upon waking [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\n2. **Pinching Sensation**: Notice if you experience a pinching sensation in your arms. This can indicate that a nerve is being compressed, which is a hallmark of neuropathy [Video 2: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:14-07:19].\n\n3. **Positioning**: Reflect on your sleeping or sitting positions. If you often rest your arms on hard surfaces or in a way that restricts blood flow, this could contribute to nerve compression [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 08:00-08:05",

Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

A key sign of crutch palsy is the inability to move your arms, which may occur if the radial nerve is compressed. This can happen if you rest your arm on a hard surface for an extended period, leading to nerve compression [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 07:32-07:36].\n\n2. **Assess Sensation**: Pay attention to any numbness or tingling sensations in your arm. If you wake up and feel a loss of sensation or movement, it may indicate nerve damage or palsy [Video 1: 6kQEDRQdJZ8, Time: 08:00-08:05].\n\n3. **Consider Positioning**: Reflect on your positioning during sleep or rest. If you often fall asleep with your arm in a position that puts pressure on the radial nerve (like resting on a hard surface), this could contribute to developing crutch palsy [Video 1].\n\n4. **Seek Medical Advice**: If you",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

If it does lift off the floor and you feel most of your body weight on the above of your feet and your toes. The exercise is no longer working to improve ankle-dorsive flexion or stretching your calf muscles. I know I mentioned to lean your knees past your toes and a common misunderstanding that it is dangerous to do so. I used to think this myself. There are even old outdated textbooks out there saying that you should not squat having your knees past your toes. But if you do further reading and research, doing this will allow you to utilize the natural full ranges of motion of your ankles and your knees, which many athletes such as martial artists Olympic weight lifters and gymnast benefit from. Disability to move and be strong in this range of motion will not only allow you to move better, stronger, but also prevent injuries such as low back injuries, foot, self-release, sit on a chair and place a lacrosse ball or massage ball on the ground.

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Foot Positioning**: Ensure that your body weight is distributed evenly across your feet, particularly focusing on your toes and the balls of your feet. This helps maintain proper blood flow and reduces pressure on your nerves [Video 1: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 05:16-05:21].\n\n2. **Ankle Movements**: While seated, perform ankle rolls by moving your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. This can help stimulate blood flow and prevent numbness [Video 2: dqtqS_OVDGw, Time: 02:02-02:08].\n\n3. **Calf Raises**: Engage in calf raises by pushing the balls of your feet into the ground and lifting your heels. Visualize creating an arch under your foot during this exercise. Aim for 15 to 20 repetitions, performing 3 to 4 sets if possible [Video 2].\n\n4. **Knee Position**: While driving, it\u2019s acceptable to allow your knees to move slightly past your toes, as",

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were?

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can.

Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were?

So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already feel the tension in this area here and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds and I'm repeating this about five times. This is the a that I'm making. So do this 10 seconds, 5 times, after that, you move them to the T. So now we're spreading out the arms and wide, hand palms still facing down. Come high as high as you",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight.

So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

This exercise is crucial for regaining mobility and strength. You can perform this by curling your fingers down towards your palm, resembling a claw shape. Aim to do this movement about 10 times for each hand to build endurance and strength [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:32-04:34].\n\n2. **Focus on the PIP Joint**: Pay particular attention to the Proximal Interphalangeal (PIP) joint. Bend your fingers at this joint specifically, as it may be challenging initially due to stiffness or weakness following your injury. This targeted movement helps in restoring function and flexibility [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:32-04:34].\n\n3. **Consistency is Key**: Regular practice of these exercises is essential for recovery. Aim to incorporate them into your daily routine, gradually increasing repetitions as your strength improves.\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: If you experience significant pain or discomfort while",

Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

Keep your hands and arms straight throughout the exercise. Raise your hand and legs forward to five inches off the ground and then hold this position for five seconds returning to the starting position. There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg. It will engage the muscles a little bit differently and may be more challenging.",

      "answer": "To strengthen your fingers after an injury, stroke, or cast removal, you can perform a series of bending exercises. Start by focusing on the PIP (proximal interphalangeal) joint, which is crucial for finger movement. \n\n1. Begin with your fingers extended. Slowly bend each finger at the PIP joint, bringing the tip of the finger towards your palm. This movement may be challenging initially, especially if you are recovering from an injury [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:32-04:34].\n\n2. Aim to complete this bending motion for each finger about 10 times. This repetition will help improve flexibility and strength over time.\n\n3. Ensure you perform these exercises in a comfortable position to avoid straining your hand. If you experience significant pain, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.\n\n4. Gradually increase the number of repetitions as your strength improves, but always listen to your body and avoid pushing through severe discomfort.\n\nThese exercises can help regain function and strength in your fingers, promoting recovery after an injury [Video 1].",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side. You're going to get to that joint and you're going to put one finger over top the other and you're going to rub because there's a ligament there and you're going to rub this way here. Let me do it from this side, okay, okay, I think our arm was in the way box. So here we get to the joint That finger there",

And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe, you did 80%. Next week, you do 95%. So it gives you that concrete evidence. Essentially, what it's going to do is it's going to record how long it takes you to touch the number that they say. 46, four, two. And I write, and it gives you that nice, nice auditory feedback.

By doing this it works on the sub scapula muscle spindles. Do the rotation 80-10 times nice and slow, then move on to the next 10-Despot. Sub scapula are a massage with a broomstick. You can use any type of stick, as long as it hits the sub scapula muscle. Try not to use anything too thin, because it can get pointing and will hurt. Just like the static thumb massage early in the video, just lean slightly forward and then place the broomstick into your sub scapula muscle, which is at the back of the armpit against the inside of your shoulder blade. Of course, this This is going to be a lot more intense than using a thumb, as you can add weight into it by leaning forward into the tight spots. Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next position, then go back to the position, 6 to 8 times. Once again, you can use my refashion technique by adding internal and external rotation of your arm. This causes contraction and elongation of the subscaptor muscle.

One, you can of course just do full flexion. And you can work on just flexing the end of the finger tips like this, so you get that pincer grip versus the full. And that's one other one you can do Brad is you can just do pincer like this or put the two fingers together. You can work a pincer on each finger. You can actually work on just extension, of course. And then you can even hook in here and work on flexion like this, individually. So if you want to just work on flexor like this, if you want to break it down on that entailed. So there's a lot of different things you can do with that. So really cool set. Again, you can look at the website below. You know, right now I'm afraid we got to stop and let our occupational therapists have their hand out of it. And remember Brad and I can fix this about anything, except for that broken hurt. I don't know if this is going to help with that. We can make, you know, there you go. Okay, thanks.",

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Start Position**: Hold your hand in front of you with your fingers extended and your thumb out to the side.\n\n2. **Touch Each Finger**: Begin with your index finger. Bring it to touch the tip of your thumb. Hold for a moment, then return to the starting position. \n\n3. **Repeat for Each Finger**: Move on to your middle finger, then your ring finger, and finally your pinky finger, repeating the touch to the thumb for each one. This exercise can be challenging initially, especially after an injury, so take your time and do not rush through the movements [Video 1: VykLxY9mzug, Time: 04:32-04:34].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Aim to perform this exercise 10 times for each finger to build strength and coordination.\n\n5. **Safety Note**: If you experience pain or discomfort while performing these exercises, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. It\u2019s crucial to listen to your body during rehabilitation [Video 1]. \n\nThis exercise",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit.

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video. Weighted, dorsy flexion Start by sitting on a small stall with a weightlifting plate rested on your knees Drive your knees forward as possible and pass your toes without your heels coming off the ground. Do this by leaning forward and pressing gently on top of the weightlifting plate. the shifts slightly and slowly, side to side, and explore which areas you need to work on more. This is a mobilisation type stretch for the calf muscles and to increase dorsiflexion in the ankle. Hold this position for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths. Have a break for about 30 seconds and then repeat the exercise again 4 to 5 times. Once you are comfortable and confident of not losing your balance, try to do the stretch on each leg without the stool and lean a majority of your weight over one leg. This will force you to go more deeper into a stretch",

If you need to cleanse, use a gentle low pH cleanser and do not scrub at any lines drawn on your skin. Moisturizer can help your skin heal more quickly after treatment. Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

If you need to cleanse, use a gentle low pH cleanser and do not scrub at any lines drawn on your skin. Moisturizer can help your skin heal more quickly after treatment. Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack. If you have questions about how to care for your skin during radiation therapy, Ask your cancer care team or a board-certified dermatologist.",

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past",

So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional where you can go about and do your things but you're still either getting that heat if you need it or if you need that cold afterwards you can do that as well. And so it's really nice also because it's not plugged in so you can move around with it on you sometimes with traditional heating pads, you actually have to plug it in and stay in one spot, but you don't have to do it with that. They also come in different sizes in different colors. They have an extra large version. So if you need a little bit more length on the wrap around, you have that option as well.

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

You then remove the swab and you should see a nice little cutting of mucus on the swab at that point. If you don't, you should take the swab and gently insert it into the second layer. Do the same thing just repeat the entire process. Once you've got your swab out, you can either take it and go directly to point of care testing or you can take it and put it into transport media and you will see that there is a nice little reddish pink line right here which is the guide to break this off into the tube of media and as I do this on several of the children you'll see that I will actually break this",

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Use your hands to splash lukewarm water on the affected areas. Avoid using any abrasive materials such as washcloths, sponges, or luffas, as these can irritate the skin further [Video 1: M6WV95X0fRk, Time: 00:37-00:40].\n\n2. **Gentle Cleansing**: If you feel the need to cleanse your skin more thoroughly, opt for a gentle low pH cleanser. This type of cleanser is less likely to disrupt the skin's natural barrier and is safer for sensitive skin post-radiation [Video 1: M6WV95X0fRk, Time: 00:37-00:40].\n\n3. **Avoid Scrubbing**: Be cautious not to scrub at any lines or marks drawn on your skin during treatment, as this can cause irritation or damage [Video 1: M6WV95X0fRk, Time: 00:37-00:40].\n\n4. **Moisturizing",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

But once we hit a very deep but comfortable stretch, what I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a little bit like this. This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release. I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief. If the exercise is held, please support the channel by giving this video like and maybe subscribing to the channel too. If you have any comments or questions, please leave them below. I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for",

One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand.

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade.

With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot. And then at this point what we're going to do is wing the elbows down like this. We're going to push down with the head to create that passive traction. hopefully this will get it to release. If it does it, you can put a little bit more passive stretch in there, but just quickly winging the elbows down just a little bit.

      "answer": "To perform an upper back opener exercise for self-release and instant pain relief, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by finding a comfortable position, either seated or standing. Ensure you have enough space to move your arms freely.\n\n2. **Arm Movement**: Raise your arms overhead and interlace your fingers. This position helps to stretch the muscles in your upper back.\n\n3. **Stretching**: Gently lean to one side while keeping your arms extended. This action will create a stretch along the side of your upper back. Hold this position for a few seconds before switching to the other side.\n\n4. **Breathing**: As you lean, take deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps to relax the muscles and enhance the stretch.\n\n5. **Repetition**: Repeat the leaning motion several times on each side to promote mobility and relieve tension in the upper back.\n\nSafety considerations include avoiding any movements that cause sharp pain and ensuring that you maintain a comfortable range of motion throughout the exercise [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41].",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

So you want to go down as far as you're able to go, just letting gravity take it. From there what I do is wing my elbows down just a little bit and then push down with my head.

This position allows for gentle rotation and mobilization of the upper back joints. You can perform this movement by rotating your torso towards the bent knee side [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41].\n\n3. **Repetitions**: Aim for three to five repetitions of this movement. After completing the repetitions, slide down a little further on the bed and repeat the exercise, moving from the upper back to the middle back [Video 3: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 02:19-02:23].\n\n4. **Comfort Level**: Ensure you only go as far as your comfort allows.

I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder the other side shoulder When you do this you'll really feel it open up into the neck right here and a lot of times You'll get a sudden pop crack or release into the neck or into the upper back It usually feels really good again with this one don't try to force it You want to hold this one for about 15 to",

And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if",

My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can put the spine directly in between the two balls right here and glide very easily during this exercise. But I'd like to keep things simple. I'm going to be using my trusty can of beef barley soup and I'm also going to be using a towel over the can of soup or the sports cup, the other two you don't need a towel. So for demonstrated purposes, I will be using my can of soup. So if you are using the soup can, just place it in the middle of a large bath towel just like this and then roll it up and you kind of have a homemade foam roller. So there I'm just going to position it right on the upper back. So I just go",

And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

A lot of my clients come to me complaining of stiffness, tension, achiness all along this line where we all tend to hold a lot of tension and stress. Right from the side of the neck, maybe a little behind the top of the shoulder, pretty much along the path of the upper trapezius muscle, which is affected as well. So we're gonna try to see if we can release that quickly. We're gonna take our hands like this, lift the shoulder up, take a good grasp on the shoulder, the medias part of the shoulder, nice and firm, as much as it's comfortable to you, and relax the shoulder down, but keep your grip. And start to rotate the head from side to side slowly. You will feel the tissue, lengthen, stretch, slacken. You'll feel the muscles stretching and contracting underneath your hand. Keep a nice firm grip on the shoulder. It shouldn't be painful. It could be maybe a little tender or achy, maybe a good pain as if you're feeling the release of tension. Slowly come back to center. One nice big squeeze with an inhale. and exhale let the shoulder go. Notice how it feels differently from the other side. Sometimes it's a little lower. Sometimes it feels heavier. Just notice and let's do the other side. So take your hand like that. Nice big squeeze. Lift",

To focus a little bit more down into the upper back and middle backs let's go right up here and do what I like to call the Y stretch. So I'm going to put my arms up just like this to the point where I can then lean into it like this. So I'm putting my Y or my arms into a Y, my feet go together and then I'm just is using my body weight to lean forward towards the corner of that wall. This feels really good. You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it",

If you feel that one certain angle, one certain spot, like right here for me, hits it just a little bit more, throw more repetitions in, target the spots that need it the most. So here's an upper back self-release exercise. you can pretty much do anywhere. The only thing that we need is a corner of a wall or a door. I'm going to show two parts of this because they're going to target two different locations. The first part we're going to focus on a very pesky spot that a lot of people get paying, which is right here at the base of the neck into the upper back across the shoulders. This is known as an upper trapezius stretch. Very easy to do. What I'm going to do is take one arm, bend it at 90 degrees and then slide it across my lower back as much as I can. You'll feel this muscle right up here start to relax. That's that trapezius muscle from there I'm going to take my hand place it on the side right here and then I'm just going to take my ear towards the shoulder",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards the left. From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those. It's a top three exercises for neck pain and posture.",

So I'm putting my Y or my arms into a Y, my feet go together and then I'm just is using my body weight to lean forward towards the corner of that wall. This feels really good. You'll feel the stretch into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades starting to pinch and it really opens up the back. You may feel again a sudden pop or release. Hold this for about 20 seconds, relax, and then try to repeat this three to five times. You can also try different variations. So instead of going towards the Y, go towards what I like to call the feel goal. And then do the same thing. You'll notice that it just opens up the back just a little bit differently. From there, you can also go into a W. But go through all three motions. I don't know if you just heard it over the microphone, but it kind of pretty good release right there. And I just tried to do all three motions, three to five repetitions, each repetition stretch a little bit more into it, and hopefully that gets the upper back to self release. So here is what is known as an upper back corkscrew stretch, and it's a very good upper back opener",

I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.

Place one arm up against the wall at shoulder height, ensuring your elbow is straight. This will create a \"Y\" shape with your arms.\n\n2. **Body Angle**: Lean your body slightly away from the wall, towards the side of the arm that's against the wall. For example, if your right arm is against the wall, lean your body slightly to the left. This angle helps to open up the upper back effectively [Video 2: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 04:34-04:36].\n\n3. **Stretching**: Hold this position for about 20 seconds, allowing your body to relax into the stretch. On the next repetition, drive your arm over a bit more and tilt your ear towards the shoulder further to enhance the stretch [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 06:11-06:14].\n\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat this process on both sides to maintain balance in your upper back.\n\n**Safety Note**:",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

A lot of times when you have net pain, those upper trap muscles really get tight in and they'll cause more neck pain because they come all the way up those upper traps and connect to the neck area and then come down into the shoulders. So there is a couple different ways you can stretch the upper trap. The one I usually show you is where you're kind of sitting on your hand. Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching the top of my ear. Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

Lift the shoulder to get the tissue and lower the shoulder keeping your grip and and slowly rotate side to side, sensing, feeling, the tissue moving beneath your hand. If there's a part that feels a little tight or like it needs a little extra stretch, you can just hang out there with your head for a little while as you squeeze and see if you can get that to release. Coming back to center, deep, breath, squeeze the shoulder nice and tight. Exhale and let it go, roll with shoulders, dangle the arms of the sides, and just notice how it feels differently than before. If you like this, give me the thumbs up.

You want to hold this for about five seconds, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat. So just press down a little bit more with this next repetition to open up the back just a little bit more. You can do this for about three to five repetitions. From there, I just slide down a little bit and then repeat. Pretty much all the way from the upper back to the middle back. With this one too, the further that you go down the more that you're going to be able to go downwards like this, so only go to your comfort level. If you do find that one particular spot is the spot that you're having a lot of achiness or pain, stop right over that spot.

And so that helps keep it down to get a better stretch. So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee.

Ensure your back is straight and relaxed. This position helps to target the upper and middle back effectively [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41].\n\n2. **Stretching the Neck**: If you feel pain on one side of your neck, gently turn your head and neck in the opposite direction. This action helps to elongate the muscles on the painful side, providing relief [Video 2: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\n3. **Engaging the Shoulders**: While performing the stretch, it can be beneficial to hold your shoulder blade down. This stabilizes the area and enhances the effectiveness of the stretch [Video 3: xYFeFFzFftw, Time: 03:21-03:25].\n\n4. **Avoiding Incorrect Movements**: Be cautious not to bring your head down or wrap it over to the side excessively, as this could strain the upper trapezi",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

But once we hit a very deep but comfortable stretch, what I'm going to do from there is just wing my arms down just a little bit like this. This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release. I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief. If the exercise is held, please support the channel by giving this video like and maybe subscribing to the channel too. If you have any comments or questions, please leave them below.

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe,",

The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know a lot of people don't have foam rollers, so I want to give different options. Surprisingly using an extra large athletic or sports cup really contours to the shape of the back and works very well. You can also use a peanut tool that is I took two tennis balls, wrapped them in a sock, twisted it and tied it. That way you can",

From there, I'm going to press into it. Already, you should feel a very good amount of stretch into the upper back, a very good rotation because we're going towards the left. From here, what I'm going to do is press into my knee and then just turn my upper body to look away from me, so kind of like rotating a little bit towards my left. The more that you turn like this, the more it's going to open up the back and you might get a sudden pop crack or self-release, don't try to force this one, just go towards a comfortable stretch if it is going to go, it will go. But you want to hold this stretch for about 20 seconds, and it really feels good. And then from there, I just relaxed, take a breather, and then I repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, you can stretch into it just a little bit more. Again, don't try to force anything. And then when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. My personal favorite way to self-release the upper back with an extension exercise that you can do right on the floor. The easiest way to do this exercise is with a foam roller. I know",

      "answer": "To perform an extension exercise for self-releasing your upper back, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by finding a comfortable space where you can lie down on your back. Ensure that the surface is firm yet supportive.\n\n2. **Knees Up**: Bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the ground. This position helps to stabilize your lower back while you focus on your upper back.\n\n3. **Arm Placement**: Extend your arms out to the sides at shoulder height, palms facing up. This will help to open up your chest and shoulders.\n\n4. **Gentle Extension**: Slowly allow your upper back to arch gently off the ground. You can do this by pushing through your feet and engaging your core slightly to maintain stability. Focus on the area that feels tight or painful.\n\n5. **Hold and Breathe**: Maintain this position for a few seconds while taking deep breaths. This helps to release tension in the upper back.\n\n6. **Repetition**: Repeat this exercise a few times, ensuring that you do not push into pain. If you feel discomfort, ease off the stretch.\n\nThis technique can provide instant pain relief for tight spots in the upper back [Video 1: _b",

Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a tight, locked up, painful spot in the upper or middle back and need a self-release or mobilization, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over different exercises that are really going to help open up the upper back and give quick relief even in as little as 30 seconds. As a side note, these are not chiropractic adjustments. They don't serve to replace chiropractic adjustments. They're simply stretching exercises that may end in a satisfying self-pop crack or release. So let's get started and get the upper back feeling better right now. So here is an upper back opener that you can do in bed first thing in the morning or before you go to bed at night. I'm going to lay flat on my back just like this. Let's take our hands, place them behind or head little bit of support. What I'm going to do is start off by just putting my shoulders and head right off the edge of the bed. We want to focus on just letting gravity take our body weight. So it's just taking my head and shoulders and arms downwards like this. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel a stretch over the area where your",

Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible. I don't want to see your chin going up and down and you're just moving your head straight back. Just like this. Back and forth. You can do 20 or 30 at a time. You'll",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

It's a test for your shoulder blade which is your scapula and into your humerus that does a lot of internal rotation so you can imagine in a lot of sports you do a lot of motion it can cause a lot of issues, spasms and get it weak so if you can massage all those trigger points out it will definitely help you with mobility and pain relief as well, especially if you had some sort of injury, anticipation, or post surgery, this massage would definitely free it up and help you recover.

The Sub-Scaped Laris is located attached to your shoulder blade in such a young pit. When you've located the muscle, it might be slightly tender and just press gently into it. By my face, it can be quite painful. When you find the tender spot, this is called a trigger point. You can hold this position until it releases for 20-30 seconds, and then move on to the next one. Then return to the tender spot, 6-8 times, to ensure the muscle actually releases. Subscarpalara's Myrofascial release. This is",

We don't want to do this one on the lower back because that can cause irritation, but just roll up and down, just allowing gravity to take your shoulders, elbows and head down just like this. And with this rolling motion, you might get a sudden pop crack or cell for leaves. But you can do this one nice and slowly up and down for about 5 to 10 complete repetitions. If you do use the athletic cup, you probably won't be able to do this certain step, but you should be able to do the others. So let's say that you have one spot that just will not release. It's really tight, achy and painful and it needs a little bit more attention. Let's stop right over that spot.

It's really tight, achy and painful and it needs a little bit more attention. Let's stop right over that spot. From there what I'm going to do is just allow gravity to take my head, my shoulders, and elbows down towards the floor as much as we can, really put the back into a backwards extension just like this, and then from there I'm going to plant my feet on the floor and then lift my butt up, kind of like creating a bridge like exercise. This time what's going to happen is that your upper body weight is going to drive down into the can into the floor, and it really intensifies the stretch. It feels really, really good for me. And if that joint is locked up, this might get it too self-release. but you can hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds. If it feels good, hold it for longer. You can hold it upwards towards the minute, but we need to breathe out just lower your butt down like this. And then repeat it about three to five times. From there, you can just switch over different spots as needed. If it still feels like it does not watch release, what we can do from there is incorporate a little bit more dynamic movement.

This will offer a little bit more passive stretch into the upper back and you might get it to self release. I don't know if you just heard it on the microphone right there, but I did get a little bit over release. But just go very comfortably. Don't try to force anything. it's going to go, it will go, but you can do this one right here for about five repetitions, just switch over different spots as needed, and I do hope that that one right there opens up the back and gives you a lot of instant pain relief.

I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for",

And a lot of times, just doing two or three, you can already feel that you're kind of back in that upright position, your head's not forward so much. So I really like that exercise. And then the last one is just another super simple one that you can do all the time. We're just going to be an isometric exercise. A lot of time with isometric exercises, if your neck is a little bit out of alignment, or need something like a pop, do an isometric exercise not only help strengthen it, but sometimes it will help adjust your neck as well. So the one that I'm going to do for you today and you can follow along with me is a side-bent isometric exercise, but what isometric exercises are is you're contracting the muscle but you're not really moving the muscle so if you're having a lot of pain you can tighten it up you can exercise it but you're not moving to a position that might be painful or uncomfortable right now. So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout. And it gives you that objective measure. So we could say, today, Joe,",

      "answer": "To perform dynamic movements in an extension exercise for self-releasing your upper back, you can incorporate specific head and neck movements. When experiencing pain in the upper back, it is beneficial to stretch and move your head and neck in the opposite direction of the discomfort. For example, if your pain is on one side, you should turn your head away from that side and stretch towards the opposite side. This action helps to elongate the muscles that may be tight and painful, providing relief by promoting mobility in the affected area [Video 2: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Rowe emphasizes the importance of self-release techniques for tight or painful spots in the upper back, which can be achieved through various mobilization strategies [Video 1: _bZHLRfVYtU, Time: 00:38-00:41]. \n\nIn summary, dynamic movements involving the head and neck can effectively aid in self-releasing tension in the upper back, contributing to instant pain relief.",

A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle.

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

So it's not the end all fixed. There's a lot more typically you have to improve loading mechanics, going to single leg stance. You have to do some working to the hips and ankle and figure out why the heck these sink pissed off in the first place, because rarely is it actually overuse injury. It can be trauma, but overuse you wonder, well, this foot in ankle started to hurt, so why didn't this want it, the same amount of mileage, right? So there's other considerations. So that's really how you kind of lock these feelings in and make it feel better for the long haul.

So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than the other so you can grab the skin and start to move again but I just can see it's hard to grab. That's why I have the suction cup. So with the suction cups you can go in and around first the area right here where we can do the tarsal tunnel and do some simple movements or even if you like, if you have problems with running, if you have problems with impact, put it on there and jog around. be surprised that it might just reduce and keep the camera where it's at right there. So as I stand right here and as I go through some lunging, okay, or as I go through some hop-in, this is all good and fine to do as well,",

People often get these burns after accidentally touching a hot curly iron hair straightener or stove. Sunburn can also be a first degree burn. If you have a first degree burn, your skin may be red, painful, and have mild swelling. Only minor burns should be treated at home. If you experience more severe symptoms or have a burn that is very large and painful call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately. To treat a first degree minor burn follow these tips from dermatologists. Emers the burn in cool tap water or apply cool wet compresses do this for about 10 minutes or until the pain subsides. Cover the burn with a nonstick sterile bandage do not apply appointments, toothpaste or butter to the burn as these may cause an infection. If blisters form, let them heal on their own while keeping the area covered, do not pop the blisters. Consider taking over the counter pain medication, acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and reduce inflammation. First to re-burn, usually heal on their own without treatment from a doctor. However, if your first to re-burn is very large, if the victim is an infant or an elderly person, or if you think your burn is more severe, seek immediate medical care.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

      "answer": "To reduce ankle pain using skin rolling, you can employ specific techniques that target the affected area. Skin rolling involves using your fingers to manipulate the skin and underlying tissues, which can help alleviate pain associated with conditions like irritation of the nerves near the medial malleolus.\n\nStart by applying gentle pressure with your fingers to the skin around the inner ankle, specifically behind the medial malleolus. This technique can help release tension and improve blood flow to the area, potentially reducing pain. It's important to be cautious and not apply excessive force, as this could exacerbate the pain rather than relieve it. \n\nIn addition to skin rolling, consider complementary methods such as ice or heat application, and over-the-counter pain relief medications like ibuprofen, which can further assist in managing ankle pain [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 00:34-00:52]. \n\nIn summary, skin rolling can be an effective technique for reducing ankle pain, particularly when combined with other supportive measures.",

That's why I have the suction cup. So with the suction cups you can go in and around first the area right here where we can do the tarsal tunnel and do some simple movements or even if you like, if you have problems with running, if you have problems with impact, put it on there and jog around. be surprised that it might just reduce and keep the camera where it's at right there.

Now, it's really common to have pain within this area here, behind the medial malleoli and even into the arch or the heel. A lot of times, you'll consider it as a planar fashion pain, but realistically, if you look into this area, you find this actually nerves there. These nerves can create local irritation and just see it seems like it's the planar fashion and all this other stuff. stuff. So all we're going to do first is actually we're going to use some skin rolling techniques and by skin rolling all you're going to do is just grab the skin and just imagine a piece of dental floss or a fishing line going to eat the skin and it moves every time you move the ankle. Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than",

That's why I have the suction cup. So with the suction cups you can go in and around first the area right here where we can do the tarsal tunnel and do some simple movements or even if you like, if you have problems with running, if you have problems with impact, put it on there and jog around. be surprised that it might just reduce and keep the camera where it's at right there.

Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And the neck exercise I'm talking about is doing cervical retraction. So it looks a little bit like this. You're going to be keeping your face as flat as possible.

Okay? So it's a little bit non-specific in this case other than the fact that we're going to go down this track right here. So I'm just going to grab the biggest chunk of skin I can and I'm just going to move the ankle around and move the toes. Okay? As I get a little bit lower it's a little bit harder to grab but you can actually grab as you you can see I can grab some skin right there and it might be surprised it's a little bit more irritated sometimes on this side than the other so you can grab the skin and start to move again but I just can see it's hard to grab. That's why I have the suction cup.

This technique helps to increase blood flow to the area, which may alleviate discomfort. The suction cup creates a negative pressure that can lift the skin, promoting circulation and potentially reducing pain associated with inflammation or strain [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 02:06-02:09].\n\nWhile using the suction cup, it's beneficial to move the ankle around and perform gentle exercises, such as lunges or hops. This dynamic movement, combined with the suction effect, can enhance the therapeutic benefits by mobilizing the joint and surrounding tissues [Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 01:23-01:29; Video 1: lRO4l8QkAzM, Time: 01:58-02:00]. \n\nIn summary, using a suction cup on the ankle while engaging in gentle movements may help reduce pain by improving circulation and promoting mobility.

So hopefully that makes sense but that's one reason, that's this really the second reason why I would avoid crowns is that it changes the bite surface of your natural teeth to a prosthetic and it's really in an area that that's not super beneficial for you. Maybe even a third reason why you might want to avoid having a crown done on a front tooth. You've heard of the reason we would typically do a crown as to make it stronger, help hold a tooth together that's had a lot of decay or old restorations. And we would put the crown on top. And we put it on top and you have chewing forces like this. It's going, the crown's going to actually be giving that tooth additional strength. The fact that that tooth doesn't have a mammal there anymore is not too damaging, considering the forces this way. Now, if you take a front tooth, so you have a tooth in front where you, your forces really are more of this type of chewing forces where you go like that and you have a little bit of lateral forces on the front teeth, those lateral forces on teeth that you've taken all the enamel away are not very healthy. And so I've seen a lot of patients who have had crowns on front teeth and their teeth are severely weakened and they will have the tooth break. And I'm wondering if they wouldn't have broken, if we",

And that sounds okay except for the the fact that long term, this causes your lower teeth to get more wear and it's also likely to have wear on the backside of your restoration or chipping or breaking the crown over time because of the way that the bite connects. So hopefully that makes sense but that's one reason, that's this really the second reason why I would avoid crowns is that it changes the bite surface of your natural teeth to a prosthetic and it's really in an area that that's not super beneficial for you. Maybe even a third reason why you might want to avoid having a crown done on a front tooth. You've heard of the reason we would typically do a crown as to make it stronger, help hold a tooth together that's had a lot of decay or old restorations. And we would put the crown on top. And we put it on top and you have chewing forces like this. It's going, the crown's going to actually be giving that tooth additional strength. The fact that that tooth doesn't have a mammal there anymore is not too damaging, considering the forces this way. Now, if you take a front tooth, so you have a tooth in front where you, your forces really are more of this type of chewing forces where you go like that and you have",

The topic of this video came up from just this last week. I had a patient come in and had some concerns with their smile and wanted to improve it. And they came to me and they were fairly young and they were recommended to have. I believe it was like 20 crowns performed and prepped on their teeth. And they were very young. Obviously it's a big concern to me. I advise the patient definitely don't do that. Go to a dentist that is going to be able to prepare the teeth much more minimally so you have the best chance of having long term health there and here at Innovative Dental, we pride ourselves in that. So hopefully this video is helpful. My goal here is to just try to educate and bring some insight",

You've heard of the reason we would typically do a crown as to make it stronger, help hold a tooth together that's had a lot of decay or old restorations. And we would put the crown on top. And we put it on top and you have chewing forces like this. It's going, the crown's going to actually be giving that tooth additional strength. The fact that that tooth doesn't have a mammal there anymore is not too damaging, considering the forces this way. Now, if you take a front tooth, so you have a tooth in front where you, your forces really are more of this type of chewing forces where you go like that and you have a little bit of lateral forces on the front teeth, those lateral forces on teeth that you've taken all the enamel away are not very healthy. And so I've seen a lot of patients who have had crowns on front teeth and their teeth are severely weakened and they will have the tooth break. And I'm wondering if they wouldn't have broken, if we would have been more conservative and kept the enamel on the backside of their front teeth. All right, so hopefully I made it clear why I'm apparently done, just gonna hang out. That's my dog, the extra, you can't see what we're in in the corner. Time. All right, so hopefully I've made the case for what are some of the risks or challenges",

You know, cool, I've got, you made me understand why I don't need a crown, but what am I supposed to do? I believe that most dentists that are really providing the most conservative care are going to be comfortable doing three-quarter crowns or partial crowns that don't cut down the backside of the tooth. And they will also be able to do veneers. and veneers are just maybe similar to a three-quarter pound, maybe even a little more conservative than that in their prep. These are great ways to avoid long-term challenges or problems with your teeth. So I would encourage you to go to a dentist who has the ability to create same-day restorations. That'll be a big benefit to you. And go to a dentist who understands how to prepare teeth for veneers and doesn't require or recommend crowns when the backside of the tooth is healthy. The topic of this video came up from just this last week. I had a patient come in and had some concerns with their smile and wanted to improve it. And they came to me and they were fairly young and they were recommended to have. I believe it was like 20 crowns performed and prepped on their teeth. And they were very young. Obviously it's a big concern to me. I advise",

      "answer": "Crowning of the teeth significantly alters the biting surface by modifying the natural contours and functional areas of the teeth. When a traditional crown is placed, especially on the backside of front teeth, it can change the surface where chewing occurs. Specifically, the area where the front teeth meet during biting is crucial for effective chewing. If this area is ground away to accommodate a crown, it can lead to an altered biting surface that may not align properly with opposing teeth, affecting the overall occlusion and function of the bite [Video 2: LL854--GBy4, Time: 05:34-05:36].\n\nMoreover, maintaining the natural tooth structure is essential for preserving the integrity of the biting surface. The natural contours of the teeth are designed to facilitate efficient chewing, and any alteration can lead to discomfort or functional issues [Video 1: LL854--GBy4, Time: 05:05-05:10]. In summary, while crowns are necessary for restoring damaged teeth, they can change the biting surface, which may impact chewing efficiency and overall dental function.",

Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of pain and the decrease of foot pronation and nevicular drop meaning the reduction of flat feet. So if you're suffering from foot pain, plantar fasciitis, or flat feet, please try out the exercises in this video.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps",

There are some variations you can use while doing the Superman exercise. In this variation, you can start just using your opposite hand and leg.

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch.

The exercise involves rolling your eyes in a circular pattern. Here\u2019s how to do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Start Position**: Focus on a point in front of you to stabilize your gaze.\n2. **Eye Movement**: Slowly roll your eyes upwards, then move them to the right side, downwards, to the left side, and back to the starting point. This creates a full circle.\n3. **Follow the Finger**: As you perform this exercise, you can use a finger to guide your eye movement. Move your finger in a circular motion, encouraging your eyes to follow it closely.\n4. **Repetition**: Repeat this circular motion several times, ensuring that you maintain a smooth and controlled movement.\n\nThis exercise not only helps in strengthening the eye muscles but also improves coordination and focus. It is essential to perform this exercise gently to avoid straining your eyes. If you experience any discomfort, stop the exercise immediately [Video 1: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 00:31-00:40].",

Discuss your options with your care team, including your dermatologist. To avoid irritation, avoid shaving on a skin that receive treatment. Choose fragrance-free skin care products. Do not use sticky products like medical tape, stick on bandages, or nicotine patches. Protect your skin from the sun by seeking shade, wearing protective clothing, and applying a broad spectrum water resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all skin not covered by clothing, and avoid contact with very hot or cold temperatures that can further irritate your treated skin, such as a heating pad or ice pack.

So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit.

And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional where you can go about and do your things but you're still either getting that heat if you need it or if you need that cold afterwards you can do that as well.

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps",

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

I speak fine, but in actualities, speech therapy kind of encompasses so much more than just the act of talking. So typically when a patient is admitted on the stroke unit or the head injury unit will evaluate a multitude of different skill areas, including swallowing disorders, including speech, language skills, voice ability, and also something called cognitive linguistic skills. Okay, so what that incorporates is everything from your ability to maintain attention, concentration, problem-solving skills, short-term memory, working memory, all the way down to something called deductive reasoning skills. So that's the main area that we've been addressing since you've been here, it's not that you have any swallowing trouble, you know, speech issues, it's more, you know, focusing on that short-term memory, that divided attention to help, you know, with things like multitasking when you're at home or at work, and we do that, you know, as you know, in with a multitude of different activities. Okay, so the one activity that I want to work on today is actually with our iPad. Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And",

If we have concern that the child or adult has a more significant illness, something more contagious like TV, then full precautions with all the body gear would be appropriate. But in the setting where you're going to be doing nice and fair and geospob's typically all you need are a pair of gloves. Some people may choose to also put on a little face shield or a mask if they feel like the kid might cough on them and then cause them to catch illness but that's more to protect you than anything. As it told you, I've collected several thousand nice and fair and geospob's over the past several years doing point of care research. So for me, the depth of insertion of an nasal pharyngeal R&B swab is fairly intuitive and I can do it almost with my eyes closed, but I would recommend keeping them open. The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would",

So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so what I really like about using heat therapy and cold therapy is the general rule if you're doing stretches and exercises is to use heat before to help loosen up the muscles. And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional",

Sit on a bench or a chair that will allow you to have your knees bent at approximately 90 degrees and pinch a tennis ball with both heels. This creates slight foot e-version, meaning it rolls your ankles outwards and your heels inwards. Then push the balls of your feet into the ground to lift the heels up. and squeezing the calf muscles like a calf raise. Try and visualize squeezing and creating an arch under your foot at the same time. Do this for 15 to 20 repetitions 3 to 4 sets. Avoid having the tennis ball forward towards the ground throughout the whole exercise. This will help or lengthen and strengthen the muscles in the feet and the calves to help support the feet and reduce foot pain and leg pain. By squeezing the ball between the feet, it will help promote you squeezing the muscles that create a notch in the foot. Like other natural curves in the body, like the spine, archers are very important to support our body weight. A paper was published in the journal of sports rehabilitation in 2019 October on the research of intrinsic foot exercises and how it affected the nevicular drop in the foot and foot pain aka the drop of the foot arch. After six weeks of the exercises patients reported back with the reduction of",

And then the cold therapy afterwards, so after you've gotten everything excited and working, use that cold therapy to cool it back down, and so what I really like about their wraps are you can use heat therapy with it and you can use cold therapy with it. So you can heat it up in the microwave and then afterwards you can put it in the freezer and cool it back down to do the cold therapy. They've also changed their design a little bit. You might have seen me talk about these in the past but they added an elastic band here which is really nice because it helps just hold the wrap on your neck a little bit better. And so once you get that band in, you can really move around. You know, I can bend my head, I can turn to the side and it's not going to fall off. So it makes it really functional where you can go about and do your things but you're still either getting that heat if you need it or if you need that cold afterwards you can do that as well. And so it's really nice also because it's not plugged in so you can move around with it on you sometimes with traditional heating pads, you actually have to plug it",

This will serve as your focal point.\n\n3. **Eye Movement Exercise**: Begin by rolling your eyes in a circular pattern. Start by looking up at the pen, then move your gaze to the right, down, left, and back to the starting point. Ensure that your movements are smooth and controlled. This exercise helps in strengthening the eye muscles by encouraging full range of motion [Video 2: OwCEobuxQOY, Time: 00:31-00:40].\n\n4. **Repeat the Exercise**: Perform this eye movement exercise several times, ensuring you maintain focus on the pen throughout the circular motion.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: If you experience any discomfort or strain during these exercises, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. It's important to ensure that you are not overexerting your eyes during rehabilitation.\n\nBy incorporating these steps, you can effectively work on strengthening your eye",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can. And we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet. So even after you blow it out and you feel like you may be empty, I'll",

The depth of insertion is actually easily measured and there is a handy guide that copin supplies where you can look and see the measurement from the earlobe to the base of the nose, right here where the flesh ends and you would take that measurement and then divide it into two. So if you had four inches on the ruler, you would take an actually mark on your swab where two inches would be. So in this case, you would mark right about the junction of the thick portion of the swab narrowing down. In the case of the adult on this particular swab that works out perfectly almost every time for this junction to be the correct of insertion with the child or an infant you're going to go a little less deep so measuring is often very good especially in the younger kids so that you don't insert the swab too far.

I'm here today to help produce a video To help train people have to do correct nasopharyngeal swabs. My expertise in point of care testing has had me to obtain several thousand of these. So I thought I would help impart a little of that knowledge and expertise to you today. There were two different swabs today that were going to feature. The first swab, these are both made by Copenh. They are the mini-tipped flocked swabs. You can see that there's a little fine kind of bristly in. I tell people it's kind of analogous to the fuzzy part of a pipe cleaner. Some people don't know where a pipe cleaner is anymore. The top swab has a little thicker, less flexible shaft. The lower swab has a little longer portion of the narrow shaft and is more flexible. I actually prefer the top swab more for collection, both in children and adults, all the white from infants or adults, because the top less flexible area actually lets me have better control of the swab. When I place it in and go under the inferior turbinates you can actually feel as you do the rotation that you're actually getting",

This helps in accessing the nasopharynx more easily.\n\n3. **Insertion Depth**: The depth of insertion for the swab should be measured based on the patient's anatomy. Generally, insert the swab until you reach the resistance point, which is typically about 5 to 7 centimeters from the nostril for adults. For children, the depth may vary, so it\u2019s crucial to adjust accordingly based on their size.\n\n4. **Sample Collection**: Once the swab is at the correct depth, rotate it gently for a few seconds to collect the sample. \n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Always wear a mask or shield to protect yourself from potential respiratory droplets during the procedure [Video ",

In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you to take a fast you both all the way in and I'll tell you to blast it out and just want you to immediately blow it out as hard and as fast as you can. And we have certain flow and volume criteria that we have to meet. So even after you blow it out and you feel like you may be empty, I'll",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is",

We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

You'll feel a little bit of strengthening kind of anteriorly in the front of the neck and a little bit of stretch in the back of the neck. Make sure you're not moving your whole body and just make sure that you're using just your head. so that's my favorite neck exercise. I hope you guys got a lot out of the series on the neck and I will talk to you guys later. Bye!",

So the first structure that actually cause you a shoulder pin is your neck. shoulder pin can arise from your neck, especially if you're suffering from a ridiculously, which is essentially a nerve which is being pinched in the neck. And you know when you have a ridiculously, because you have this shooting pin from your, from your neck into your shoulder, into your elbow, into your arms, some of the even to your fingers. And the test where you can do is what we call the foreminal compression test. And what you need to do, so say my right shoulder is the the effect that is the effect that's side, as you need to turn your head to the right and until your head backwards. And if that reproduces your shoulder pain or this can also give you a pain between your shoulder blades, if that reproduces it, then most likely your shoulder pain stems from your neck. So something to be done with your neck. This second structure that can cause a shoulder pain is a structure that we call the brachial plexus and that's a structure in anatomical structure, consists",

Well, the other story I was real quick. My mom had to go into a nursing home and to get some treatment I know those stories. You know the story and she goes, you guys are like Jesus, you take care of the sick and you make people better So, that's going to go on a little, that's going to go on a little part.

      "answer": "To address a crick in your neck by bending toward the affected side, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Affected Side**: Determine which side of your neck feels stiff or painful. This will guide your movement.\n\n2. **Position Yourself**: Sit or stand comfortably. Ensure your posture is relaxed to avoid additional strain.\n\n3. **Bend Your Head**: Gently tilt your head toward the side where you feel the crick. For example, if your right side is affected, lean your head to the right. This movement can help relieve tension in the neck muscles.\n\n4. **Test for Pain**: You can perform a test known as the foraminal compression test. Turn your head toward the affected side and slightly tilt it backward. If this reproduces your pain, it indicates that the issue may stem from your neck [Video 2: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time: 01:48-01:54].\n\n5. **Monitor Symptoms**: If the pain intensifies or does not improve, consider consulting a healthcare professional, as persistent neck pain may indicate a more serious condition [Video 1: 4h3V6F4Rl_k, Time: ",

And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure on your the hump area, the base of your neck. So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms,",

So a very good exercise for this to do, are your chin tucks, you've probably seen them online, but what I'm going to do is I'm going to turbocharity. So I'm going to give you turbocharity, chin tucks that will get your results quicker. And what you need for them is you need a taraband, you can also use a towel. And what we're going to do is we're going to place the band around our head. We're going to do what we call isometric exercises. So with isometric exercises, it means you place your head in the right position. They create a force of pull, but make sure that your head doesn't leave that position. So keep it in position. So you need to be upright, chin in, nice upright. Imagine there's like a little thread on top here. On your head and you're pulling it forward, so you've got nice upright, chin in, shoulders forward. Make sure you're tense your tummy muscles as well. Your core muscles as well. And all you do now is you pull with your arms, Pony elastic band, keep it forward, do not push it, do it gently forward, keep it gently nicely tucked in and you pull it, you hold this for about five to ten seconds, aeropheed five to ten times. Now that's all you do, tilt the charge, I can already really feel it to the front here, make sure you know your chin is nice",

What you want to do for this is grab a roll towel, place it behind the smaller, the arch of your neck. Laying flat on your back, you can bend your knees for comfort to protect your lower back if you like. What you're going to do is tuck your chin, straight back into the tail. Okay, this is a pretty small movement, but it's important for strengthening the muscles and the neck that control not only your bones in your neck, you're neck vertebrae. Go ahead. Ten second hold, and then relax. It should feel pretty relaxing for people who have headaches that start right here. It's called a sub-assiminal headache, starts right here, travels up and over, can be on one side. This is a great exercise for them. The thing that economy happens is with bad posture, head falls forward. We want to strengthen these muscles to bring the chin and the head back into the position that they're supposed to be. This is called chin tuck, ten second hole. The second exercise is scapular retraction. What that really means is squeezing your shoulder blades down and back. Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as",

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

Weakness in the front neck muscles can lead to poor posture, increasing the risk of neck strain [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 08:06-08:08].\n\n2. **Performing Chin Tucks**: To perform chin tucks, pull your chin straight back towards your throat without tilting your head up or down. This action engages the muscles in the front of your neck, counteracting the weakness caused by poor posture [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 08:19-08:22].\n\n3. **Using Resistance**: For enhanced results, you can use a resistance band (taraband) during the exercise. This adds an element of resistance, making the exercise more effective [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 08:19-08:22].\n\n4. **Repetitions**: Hold each chin tuck for 5 to 10 seconds and repeat this exercise about 5 to 10 times",

If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades. And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a lot of pain and stress on that area so the way to stretch that one out is this one's going to be a little bit differently so again you're going to use your arm but this time is going to go up so you can either just raise your arm or I like to kind of put it back this way where my elbows",

Today I'm gonna show you it a little bit differently, but if you have some shoulder issues, this might be a little uncomfortable. So do which one is more comfortable for you. This time you're just gonna place your hand behind your back. So my hand's just kind of in the middle of my lower back in my elbows to the side right here. So I'm keeping it close to my body. This is the side I wanna stretch. I'm gonna take my other hand and bring it up and over. Almost where I'm touching the top of my ear. Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one",

Then I'm gonna gently pull my ear over towards that side, keeping my shoulder down low, getting that stretch right through here. And you're gonna hold that stretch for 30 seconds. If you want more of a stretch, take the elbow on that side and pull downwards towards the floor, or if you're sitting in a chair down towards the chair. And that'll give you that extra stretch in there. 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side, but remember with a stretch, you don't want it to be painful, you want it to be tension, whereas that hurts so good feeling. So then the next stretch is gonna be the levator scapulae stretch. And that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our lifts up our shoulder blades. And so a lot of times when we're holding stress, We overwork that muscle in it tightens and we kind of sit up in this position and that can cause a lot of neck pain because that that muscle again goes all the way up into that cervical spine or that neck area and put a",

And you also need to do this for the side, so you come to the side to the left, up right here, nice post your upright pull to the side and then you can use it with the towel as well that's really making an awful lot of difference to decide here. Hold this five ten seconds and repeat about five to ten times and obviously you need to do the other side as well. The only thing you shouldn't do is forward and then pull it forward because the last thing you want to do is you don't want to strengthen the back of your neck because that's already strong enough. So turn with your chin tucks it will help you to reduce the hump and keep it used as well because your posture is actually getting better and you're better at the line.

      "answer": "To use ear drops effectively, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Have the person lie on their side with the ear that needs treatment facing upwards. This position allows for better access to the ear canal and ensures that the drops can flow downwards towards the eardrum [Video 1: v0HODFTrkqs, Time: 00:18-00:24].\n\n2. **Ear Preparation**: Gently pull the outer ear (pinna) upwards and backwards to straighten the ear canal. This helps in visualizing the ear canal and allows the drops to reach deeper.\n\n3. **Application**: Administer one drop at a time into the ear canal. After each drop, press gently on the front of the ear to assist the drop in reaching the eardrum. This technique helps ensure that the medication is effectively delivered [Video 1].\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue applying drops as prescribed, ensuring that all necessary doses are administered.\n\n5. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure the ear drops are at room temperature before use to avoid dizziness. Avoid touching the dropper tip to any surfaces to prevent contamination.\n\nFollowing these steps will enhance the effectiveness of ear drop treatment.",

You should ask your healthcare provider to test you with Spirometry if you are over 40 and you're a small kid or an ex-smoker. if you are out of breath, or if you cough very frequently bringing up a lot of mucus. In general, if you are concerned for your lung health, or if you are already diagnosed with a lung disease. Spirometry is a very sensitive test and can catch a lung disease at its very early stages. Hi, welcome to the Pomona Function Lab, I'm Mark, and I'll be doing your spirometry today. So on this test we will ask you to exert yourself, so I want you to be comfortable and we don't want any clothing that's going to restrict your chest expansion or your performance. So if you want to take your jacket off and make yourself comfortable, and I'll ask you to have a seat here. So we are primarily measuring the total amount of air you can blow out, but also, we're measuring how fast you can blow it out. We're trying to measure that maximum amount. You can blow out in the first second. So after you get on the mouth piece and put the nose clip on, I'll ask you to begin with a few normal breaths. And then at a certain point, I'll ask you",

Now with the ruse test what you need to do is stick your arms up like this, 90 degree in the shoulder, 90 degree in your elbows, then pull your arms back a little bit so you pull your arms a little bit and then what you do for three minutes is you open and shut your hands. Now this test is positive if you have a heaviness or weakness in the arms or if you get numbness and tingling in the hands. Now you will get obviously tired when you do this. You're looking for really heaviness and and the weakness in the arms. For three minutes, if that's positive, then your shoulder pain might be caused by a compression of the brachial plexus. The third structure that can cause a shoulder problem is a tear in one of the irritator cuff muscles. So the irritator cuff muscles are muscles around the joint and keep the joint into place. And I'll shift you to give you the two most common ones, the commonness, the tear of a muscle in the rotator cuff is in a muscle called the superspannatus and what we do for this one is the empty can test. So what you do with this is you straighten out your arm, you point your thumb towards the ground so you get like a 30 degree angle front here and then with the other hand you apply a little bit of pressure and you resist it",

And this mouthpiece is like a snorkeling mouthpiece, so I need your lips over the outside portion of it and your teeth go behind it, teeth bind it on the two tabs. And just want to be sure, tongue is not including the hole in the mouthpiece. And just want you to begin with some normal breathing. All right, and I'll take a nasty breath in and blast it out. Keep blowing, keep blowing, keep going, you're doing great. Keep going, keep pushing out, keep pushing, and ghee, boi, shing. Take a fast, you breath on the way back in. It's great, you can come off that mouthpiece, and you can take those noseclubs off. As you can see, spirometry is an easy test to take.",

A technician will assist you during the test.\n\n3. **Using the Mouthpiece**: Place the mouthpiece in your mouth, ensuring a tight seal with your lips. You may be instructed to wear nose clips to prevent air escape through the nose [Video 2: Zs8Fs5HaJHs, Time: 02:47-02:50].\n\n4. **Performing the Test**: Take a deep breath in, then exhale forcefully and continuously into the mouthpiece.

The sprain can take three to six weeks to heal, but treating it properly can promote healing. Here's how to treat a foot sprain. One, rest the foot as much as possible, sit whenever you can. Two, elevate your foot to the level of your chest. a pello under your heel to prevent pressure source. 3. Apply ice to the top of your foot and under and around your ankle. 30 minutes on and 30 minutes off for the first 48 hours to help reduce swelling and pain. 4. Take aspirin or acita menifin for pain. 5. Apply warm compresses to the foot after 48 hours. Heat dilates blood vessels and provides increased circulation to the injured body part. 6. Walk with the support of an arm, cane, or crutches for the first week. 7. Wrap an elastic bandage around the foot when walking to provide additional support to your arch. 8. Look at your foot. It should be pink and rosy, not gray or bluish. Even though your foot is sprained, you must have an adequate blood supply going there. If you feel circulation is compromised, call your doctor.",

Position the solve your foot on the ball and gently roll your foot over the ball. Spend more time around the tender areas. Roll the lacrosse ball up and down from the heel to the ball of your foot, allowing the structures of your feet to relax and almost wrap around the ball. Roll up and down under your foot for 20 strokes on each tender area and move on to the next. Make sure you return to the tender area again for 2-6 times. Repeat the process. Once you are ready to add more pressure on the feet, you can stand up and add more body weight onto the bottom of your feet, but please be careful. Even for me, this is quite painful to do. This will passively move the joints of the feet walls, massaging and stripping the muscles in the feet. This can help release tight muscles, reducing spasming in the feet and the legs. Therefore reducing pain and tenderness in other areas such as the leg, I'll put a link in the description box below a way to get this massage ball. Once again guys, thanks for watching.

This helps prevent further injury and promotes healing [Video 1: bUgV89cdfTM, Time: 00:43-00:48].\n\n2. **Elevation**: Elevate your foot to the level of your chest. This can be achieved by propping it up on pillows or cushions. Elevation helps reduce swelling and improves blood circulation to the area [Video 1: bUgV89cdfTM, Time: 00:43-00:48].\n\n3. **Ice**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided evidence, applying ice to the sprained area can help reduce swelling and numb pain. Typically, ice should be applied for 15-20 minutes every hour as needed.\n\n4. **Compression**: Use a compression bandage to support the foot and reduce swelling. Ensure it is snug but not too tight to avoid cutting off circulation.\n\n5. **Rehabilitation Exercises**: Once the initial pain subsides, gentle exercises can be introduced. For example, perform calf raises while pinching a tennis ball between your heels to",

First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken the muscle there, and that goes a long way towards relieving the pain. Okay guys, so this is my favorite exercise for the neck. I think of this kind of a control-alt delete for your neck pain. So you can do this when you're having an acute episode of neck pain, or you can also do it as just a general strengthening exercise. And",

Okay, and it's an application called visual attention going to the practice mode first. Okay, and what it's going to do is it's going to give you either a symbol or a letter. And what you have to do is you have to touch each one of the indicated symbols or letters as as quickly and efficiently as you can, okay? So what you're looking to do is you're looking to make sure you don't miss any, but at the same time, you know, maintaining a pace that is going to work for you. Okay, so we'll start with the practice, all right, and we'll start with similar letters, and then we can always switch it up. Okay, so it's touch each target in order from left to right, tap to bottom. So essentially the same way you'd read a book. Okay, all right, so now we have every eye and each. Okay, this actually helped me find the effect I miss one on that line. Yeah, exactly. Plans to you. How many seconds it took? How many targets there were? And what percentage you found on the first try? So that's what is nice about this app because it records everything for you. So it kind of takes some of the workout.

What is sciatic and well-explained or numbness or can you leave them run down the back your leg? Most of the time caused by some problem of your your core back. If we can teach you the right strengthening and stabilization exercises to help minimize some of that problem, you're going to feel a lot better. That is my goal with this video So, in fact, in an effort to serve you even better, this is part two of a two-part video series of home exercises that you can do for your sciatic nerve pain. In video 1, I showed you the best stretches and mobilization techniques to help to eliminate your pain and help your sciatic symptoms to feel better. In this video, what we need to follow that up with is the right core strengthening and love bar stabilization techniques in order to keep your sciatic nerve symptoms away. That's exactly what I hope to share with you in this video. If you're interested in checking out Part 1, check out the link in the description down below. I will also recap at the end of this video and I hope that helps you out. That being said, perhaps I'm going to space on the floor. First exercise is coming your way now. One of the best ways to",

So what are we talking about? That's a lot of service, isn't it, though? Yeah. The clavicle is the collarbone, okay? So that's this right here. I'm actually leaning forward like that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, how does that look? Got the collar bone and it attaches to another bone right here, which is the acromion, and it forms a joint right there. The acromion is nothing more than part of the shoulder blade in the scapula. But this is the pain that we had on video, I'll probably put it up right here on how to test whether or not you are having acromion to AC joint pain. If it's positive, one of the simple tests is just to bring the arm across like this and it hurts. it up in that thing. A lot of people who are having trouble with push-ups or bench press who may feel this. So this is a simple treatment you're going to do. There's others and we'll talk about those. But right now the first treatment you want to try is you're going to take your hand and you're going to follow along your own collarbone. Let's say it's the left side.",

So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out. That's typically the cause. So instead of stretching and moving away from the pain, I want you to actually move towards the pain and kind of side bend towards the side that hurts, rotate towards the side that hurts, and then also use a pillow to kind of prop your arm up like this, or anything that you can elevate your arm on to help slacken",

So you often kind of feel pain down in there. So tomorrow we'll talk about what to do when you have this kind of muscular pain, and what's the best way to start getting rid of some of that pain? See you tomorrow. Okay, so you have an acute episode of neck pain, what should you do? First off, go ahead and do all those things that you normally would do if for any other type of muscular injury, do some ice, if you like it, do some heat, if you like it, take some ibuprofen, or some adult, all those things are good. The one thing that most people do that I think is opposite of what they should actually do is they actually to try to stretch and move their head and neck in the opposite direction of the pain. Meaning like if my head neck hurt on this side, they're kind of stretching to this side, they're turning away from it, trying to make this side longer when these muscles here are already hurting because they're stretched out.

So the motion you're going to be doing is this way. Keeping your shoulders down, your head going over but your head's not actually going to move. You're going to place your hand on the side of your forehead here on your temple area and then you're just going to push into your hand. So see my head's not moving you might see it move just a little bit, but all I'm doing is I'm activating these muscles over here on the side. When you first do this, just hold it for about three to five seconds, but don't push as hard as you can to start off with because it might be a little uncomfortable. Maybe do 30 to 40 percent of as hard as you think you can push. So pushing over to the side, this is the motion I'm doing, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm pushing into my hand and then I like to go back and forth on each side. Instead of doing them all on one side, I just like to alternate back and forth just to give the",

      "answer": "To identify if an exercise is mitigating pain, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Assess Pain Levels**: Before starting any exercise, note your current pain level. This will serve as a baseline for comparison after the exercise.\n\n2. **Engage in Recommended Activities**: Begin with general pain management strategies such as applying ice or heat, and consider taking over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen if necessary. These methods can help reduce discomfort before exercising [Video 1: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:36-02:41].\n\n3. **Perform Gentle Movements**: Instead of stretching towards the painful side, gently move your head and neck in the opposite direction. This is crucial as stretching the already painful muscles can exacerbate the issue. For instance, if pain is on the right side, avoid stretching to the right and instead turn your head to the left [Video 1: 1Nr6wPFz09A, Time: 02:51-02:56].\n\n4. **Monitor Pain Response**: After performing these movements, reassess your pain level. If there is a noticeable reduction in pain, the exercise may be effective. Conversely, if pain increases, stop the",

Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

So the neck hump or the dowager's hump is very often the result of a prolonged poor posture. It's especially when we're looking at our phones or tablets or when we're sitting and working at a desk and our shoulders come forward and we sit slouch. We're placing a lot of pressure on the base of our neck on this area here. And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing",

I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy.

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

And you turn, left, and right. And you're definitely going to feel on here a bit of crunching when you're doing this. If it doesn't hurt, don't worry about it. It's good, it loosens tissue off. So that's actually fine. So really pull your arms up as high as possible you can and turn your head to the left and the right.

Good posture is crucial as it helps alleviate pressure on the neck area, which can contribute to the formation of a hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 01:16-01:19].\n\n2. **Mobilization Exercise**: The specific exercise involves gentle mobilization of the neck region. This can include tilting your head side to side and forward and backward to increase flexibility and reduce tension in the connective tissues that may have built up due to poor posture [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 01:49-01:46].\n\n3. **Combine Techniques**: It's essential to combine this mobilization with consistent posture correction throughout your daily activities. This dual approach is powerful in addressing the neck hump effectively [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 01:49-01:46].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Always perform these exercises gently to avoid straining the neck. If you experience pain or discomfort, stop the exercise and",

So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure you chuck your chin in. And the first thing you do is your hand palms facing down and we're raising the arms up as high as we can. We've got about a 30 degree angle here, away from my body, raise your arms up as high as you can. I'm now making a, as you can see and I'm holding this, I can already",

Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to",

Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally.

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump. Often people who experience a neck hump or a buffalo hump also experience a bit of neck pain as well. I've done some",

I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy.

And the pressure needs to strain and the body wants to protect itself. It wants to protect the area. So what it does is it lays down a few tissues, a bit of fat, a bit of connective tissue in this area to protect it. And that's how you get your dowages hump. So what we need to do is we need to do some exercises and I can give you some exercises that will really help to significantly reduce the hump in your neck and the other thing we need to do is we need to work on posture to make sure we're nice and upright. You combine the two, you've got a very powerful combination to get rid of that hump once and for all. So the exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you next is an absolute beauty in reducing your neck hump and your dowages hump. And why is that? Because it combines mobilizing the area, so it's straightaway reducing the hump, which strengthening the area, which makes it easier for you to maintain proper posture to ensure that the hump doesn't come back. So the exercise is called the ATY mobilization exercise, and you need to lay face down for this. So I've got a mat here, I've got a towel for under my forehand. So you lay face down and make sure",

You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now we're going to make the stretch left and right by first of all holding onto the book. Come all the way down and then you drop the book, Keep your arms as wide as you possibly can. Hold this again for 10 seconds and repeat. About five times again this one today. An absolute brilliant exercise to help to reduce the delve which is hump with a neck hump. So this next exercise is a really nice practical one you can do throughout the day. So I can imagine when you're in office, you can't always put your elbows on the chair or lay face down somewhere. They might look at you a little bit, finally. So this is an exercise you can do throughout the day when",

The second exercise I'd like to show you for the neck hump, the Buffalo hump, very effective as well, simple, again, and effective. What you need to do is place your hands behind your back, grab your wrist, pull your arms, straight your elbows, pull your arms back, make sure you squeeze your shoulder blades together and then you tilt your head back and you hold this for about 30 seconds and whilst you're tilting back you're breathing out my final exercise to combat the neck hump or the buffalo hump is probably one of my one of my favorites simple exercise to do all we need is a is a wall so make sure in this case do the right arm. Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up.

So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

With this exercise what we're trying to do is flatten the hump not only by just creating pressure and pull from top to bottom but also by creating pull from left to right. We're trying to flatten the hump from all directions and all you need for this is a chair and a book. The first thing you need to do is place the book between your hands like such then you need to place your elbows on the top of the chair, create a 90 degree angle in your hips not really angled in your knees. Make sure your chin is tucked in at all the time and always now you push your upper body through your arms. Don't let your head drop forward. That will actually induce the neck hump. So keep it down your chin tucked in. You can all the way down. Now you hold this brush you can only feel the tension on the on the hump and what you need to is now you need to drop the book, drop the book, and then keep your arms, keep your hands, even these space out. And then what's going to happen? Because when you're so tight in the area where your neck hump is, your arms will collapse into. Normally what happens is you come down and you drop the book and the arms will do this straight away. So now",

You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder level, forearms perpendicular to the ground, up at 90 degree angle, lean in, should feel a general stretch across the upper chest, hold that 30 seconds, and the clinic we do three of those.

Most people when they have poor posture, their shoulders fall forward and their head falls forward. We want to work on bringing your shoulder blades together and back. So what we're going to do and you can do this at your desk or anywhere in the home as well. So that's nice and straight. Eyes level, eyes forward, chin up. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and back. The thing that we commonly see is people will shrug their shoulders up. shoulders up, as they're squeezing, your shoulder blades together and back. Let's squeeze them up at the same time. You want to avoid doing that. You want to keep your shoulders down away from your ears, down and back. Okay? And the clinic, we hold five seconds, and do it ten times. If you're feeling brave, you can do it up to twenty times. Third exercise for top three exercises for neck pain and posture is a corner stretch. Once again, what commonly happens is head falls forward, shoulders fall forward, all the muscles in the chest, and in your front, they become tight. So we want to open that up and make it easier for the shoulders to fall back into their good posture position. So what we do is find a corner that's open. Keep your eyes level, and you're just going to lean in, lightly. Little more advanced version is to keep your elbows up at shoulder",

Slide the hand up on the wall. Make sure it's nice and high. Don't do it. Here, make sure the hands are really high up and then what you need to do is you need to, in this case, right arm is up. I'm going to turn to my right and we're going to tilt the head backwards and let it rest here for about 15 seconds before I come back again and again turn to the right and tilt backwards and hold this for about 15 seconds and make sure you don't get dizzy. Be careful with this, it's a really, really, really good exercise. That's one side and obviously you need to do the other side as well. So left arm up and I'm turning to the left and I'm tilting my head backwards and hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Really good exercise, probably one of my favourites and it's very specifically targets that area of your neck where you have that bit of a of a hump. Often people who experience a neck hump or a buffalo hump also experience a bit of neck pain as well. I've done some",

So again, if this is uncomfortable for your shoulder, you don't have to do that part, but you're going to get a little bit better stretch if you can do that because it holds that shoulder blade down while you stretch. The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is",

      "answer": "To perform an advanced shoulder extension stretch exercise aimed at reducing the neck hump, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Positioning**: Start by sitting at a desk with your shoulders relaxed but not slouched. Ensure your chin is tucked in to avoid dropping your head forward, which can exacerbate the neck hump [Video 2: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 04:51-04:55].\n\n2. **Arm Movement**: Extend your arms back while keeping your elbows close to your sides. Form an \"L\" shape with your arms, pulling them back as far as comfortable. This position helps engage the muscles that counteract the forward shoulder posture [Video 3: T43753AfaKY, Time: 02:33-02:35].\n\n3. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this \"L\" position for about 30 seconds, focusing on feeling the stretch across your upper back and shoulders. This will help alleviate tension in the area and promote better posture [Video 3].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: Ensure that your head remains aligned with your spine throughout the exercise. Avoid any movements that cause discomfort or strain, particularly in the neck area [Video 1: fsd",

All you need to do, super simple, all you need to do is support the arm that holds your phone with the other hand to look. What I'm doing now is I'm supporting my elbow of the hand that holds my phone upright, suddenly my phone is upright, suddenly I'm not dropping my head forwards and not creating a lot of pressure on this area where I have my neck hump, phones upright, I can look at the phone this way, I'll create less pressure on the neck, and all the exercise that you do during the day, suddenly bare fruit, because you're taking away irritation throughout the day. So what happens over time, if you have your dowages hump or your neck hump, you've probably been walking like this for quite some time. And this kind of position, what it does is it strengthens the muscles in the back of your neck, but it weakens the muscles here in the front of your neck, around your throat. And you need to strengthen those muscles to be able to have a proper posture, be upright, and great less pressure",

I'm probably just average, I spend an average of two hours 30 minutes per day looking at my phone. I just need to go outside, go to your local supermarket, just go outside and you see the majority of people looking at the phones this way with a head tilting forwards. Now you can do all the exercises in the world, but if you keep on looking at your phone with your head drop down, no way you're going to get rid of that hump for good. So what we need to do is next to the exercise, you need to find a way to look at your phone that places less pressure on your neck, and I've got the right hack for you. All you need to do, super simple, all you need to do is support the arm that holds your phone with the other hand to look.

The important part of this stretch is you're not bringing your head down, you're not wrapping it over to the side like for that upper trap stretch, but you're bringing it down kind of in an angle where you want your nose to be at about a 45 degree angle towards your opposite knee. So it's not down and then this way it's turning your head kind of rotating it and then coming down. So elbow up, nose towards the opposite knee, hand up and over behind the head, and then you're pulling down and you should feel that stretch in that upper neck area that levator scapule muscle that goes through there and it goes all the way down to that shoulder blade. So again you're getting that nice stretch in there holding it for 30 seconds coming back up three times on each side because if you're having neck pain even if the neck pain is on one side if you have the time I'd really recommend stretching both sides because that's really just going to loosen up that whole neck area. So another great way to relieve that neck pain or reduce that neck pain is to use heat or cold therapy. And the folks at BiomedDB design LLC sent me their sunny bay hands-free neck wrap. And so",

      "answer": "To reduce neck pressure while using your cell phone, it is essential to avoid tilting your head forward. Instead, you should tilt your head backward while looking at your phone. This adjustment can help alleviate the strain on your neck that often results from prolonged forward head posture. The video emphasizes that many people tend to look at their phones with their heads tilted forward, which contributes to neck discomfort and conditions like a neck hump [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 07:20-07:23].\n\nIncorporating this technique into your routine can be beneficial. By maintaining a neutral or slightly extended neck position, you can minimize the stress on cervical structures. Additionally, it is advisable to combine this approach with neck exercises to further enhance cervical spine health [Video 1: fsdchGejKmU, Time: 06:58-07:03].\n\nIn summary, to lessen neck pressure while using your phone, tilt your head backward rather than forward. This simple adjustment, along with appropriate exercises, can help maintain better neck posture and reduce discomfort.",
