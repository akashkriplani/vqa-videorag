    "answer": "To perform a mouth cancer check at home, follow these simple steps that can be completed in about 45 seconds. \n\n**Key Steps:**\n1. **Visual Inspection**: Begin by looking in the mirror and examining your lips for any unusual lumps or ulcers that have persisted for more than three weeks [01:30-01:33]. \n2. **Check Inside the Mouth**: Use your fingers to feel along the inside of both cheeks for any lumps or bumps. Look for any red or white patches that may indicate potential issues [01:30-01:33].\n3. **Examine the Roof of Your Mouth**: Tilt your head back slightly to get a better view and check the roof of your mouth for any abnormalities [01:30-01:33].\n4. **Look Under the Tongue**: Finally, lift your tongue and check underneath for any unusual growths or lesions.\n\n**Summary**: Regular self-examinations of the mouth can help detect early signs of mouth cancer, which is crucial for effective treatment. If you notice any concerning changes, consult a healthcare professional promptly. Remember, early detection can save lives [00:29-00:36].",
