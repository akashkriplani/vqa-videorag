It can be tricky to get the right angle and you will need to tilt your head back slightly. Also run your finger along the roof of your mouth to check for any lumps or spine. Finally you should then check your lips. Simply use your thumb and index fingers to pull down your lip and check for any red or white patches or lumps. Do this for both the top and bottom lip. That's our step-by-step guide to performing a simple math cancer check at home. Most likely you won't find anything, but if you do spot something while you're doing your check that doesn't seem quite right, make sure to book an appointment with your dentist or doctor. Be math where and if in doubt get checked out. For more information about mask cancer, or to find out more about our mask cancer action month campaign, head to www.mascancer.org.",

        "text": "Hello. In this video, we're going to show you how to do a mouth-cance check. This simple check only takes 45 seconds, however it could save your life. Last year, 8,722 adults in the UK were diagnosed with mouth cancer. That's an average of 1 every hour. The number of new cases is doubled in the last 20 years, or more people are losing their life to the disease and cervical cancer and to a particular cancer combined. The key to beating mouth cancer is spotting it quickly, so it's really important everybody knows what the early wanting signs are. Without further ado, let's get into it. Firstly, take a quick look at your face and have a feel for any unusual lump saw bumps around your head and neck. Once that's clear, you can then start checking the inside of your mouth. Check your tongue for any unusual red or white patch lump or an ulcer that has lasted for longer than three weeks. Make sure to check both sides and underneath. Next, run your finger along the inside of both your cheeks. Are there any lumps or bumps? Again, can you see any red or white patches? All clear? Great. Now you should check the roof of your mouth. It can be tricky to get the right angle and you will need to tilt your head back slightly. Also run your finger along the roof of your mouth to check for any lumps or spine. Finally you should then check your lips. Simply use",

You can follow along with me and if you're interested in finding out all the other stretches from head to toe, make sure you click on the link up there. So we're going to just go with a 30 seconds stretch. We're going to do a total of three and a little 10 second rest in between. So I've got my timer ready to go and I'll kind of just explain it as we get started. So let's go ahead and start with the first stretch. So the wrong points are in the back. They kind of hold those shoulder blades together. So you're going to clasp your hands together and you're going to punch forward. Now as you punch forward, you're going to tuck your chin in. So really just trying to round out your shoulders. So if you watch a lot of my videos, you know, usually I don't want people to round out their shoulders. But to get that wrong boy stretch, you really just want to punch forward as much as you can and tuck that chin in. So you're getting that nice stretch and you're up or back area.",

Check for any unusual red or white patches on your gums, tongue, or inside your cheeks. If everything looks clear, proceed to the next step [Video 1: _6csIJAWj_s, Time: 01:37-01:41].\n\n2. **Check the Roof of Your Mouth**: Tilt your head back slightly to get a better view. Use your finger to gently feel along the roof of your mouth for any lumps or irregularities. This area can be tricky to inspect, so take your time [Video 1].\n\n3. **Inspect Your Lips**: Use your thumb and index finger to pull your lips away from your gums. Look for any unusual signs or changes in color or texture. \n\nRemember, if you notice any concerning changes, such as persistent lumps or sores that do not heal, consult a healthcare professional promptly. Regular checks can be crucial, as early detection can significantly impact outcomes [Video 1].",
