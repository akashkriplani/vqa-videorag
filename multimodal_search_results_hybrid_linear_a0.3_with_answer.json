It can be tricky to get the right angle and you will need to tilt your head back slightly. Also run your finger along the roof of your mouth to check for any lumps or spine. Finally you should then check your lips. Simply use your thumb and index fingers to pull down your lip and check for any red or white patches or lumps. Do this for both the top and bottom lip. That's our step-by-step guide to performing a simple math cancer check at home. Most likely you won't find anything, but if you do spot something while you're doing your check that doesn't seem quite right, make sure to book an appointment with your dentist or doctor. Be math where and if in doubt get checked out. For more information about mask cancer, or to find out more about our mask cancer action month campaign, head to www.mascancer.org.",

        "text": "Hi, my name is Lois Baldry and one of the skin cancer specialist nurses at the Bristol Dermatology Center. Today, I'm going to show you how to check your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are found in several areas of the body, predominantly the head, neck, armpits and groin area. Skin cancer can spread to the lymph nodes, so it's important to check them regularly in order to detect changes early. It's advisable that you check your nodes once a month. It is important not to do this too often, otherwise you may not notice any changes. It should be noted that not all swollen glands mean cancer. It is common that if you have a sore throat or a cold, your lymph nodes can temporarily enlarge as they fight infection. In large lymph nodes are not usually painful, and they often feel like a pea, olive, or smooth pebble under the skin. To check your lymph nodes, you need to check the areas closest to where you have had your skin cancer removed. It is important to check both sides of your body so that you become familiar with what is normal for you. So now we're going to show you how to check your lymph nodes from home. I've got Harriet here with me today who is kind of going to demonstrate how to do this. First of all, we're going to show you how to check your head and neck lymph nodes. If you start using your two fingers, you want to do a",

It forms when squamous cells begin to grow uncontrollably in the top layers of the skin. the way the cells can invade, but they usually don't protest the size very often. If someone did have a squamous cell on their lower lip, or if they were immunocompromised or if they were a transplant patient, they too can spread throughout the body. More than one million cases of squamous cell carcinoma are diagnosed in the U.S. each year reportedly resulting in more than 15,000 deaths. And it can be easily confused with other skin disorders. It's kind of just pink and scaly. It almost can look why something that someone would call psoriasis. This is actually a squamous cell around a nail. And here you can see the scale and the redness around here. Same thing that looks like egzema on someone's finger, but that is actually skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma. The third and most dangerous type of skin cancer is melanoma. And statistically, one person dies of melanoma every hour in the United States. There are several ways to spot melanoma.

A pig flow meter is easy to use, even children as young as four should be able to perform a pig flow with good results. Let's take a look at how it's done. Start by standing up straight, then hold the meter so that the indicator will be at the bottom when it's placed in your mouth. a really big deep breath, fill your lungs completely, then place the mouth piece in your mouth, lightly bite down with your teeth and close your lips around it. Then blast out the air is hard and as fast as you can, all in a single blow, and then record the number that appears on the meter. Repeat these steps three times and make note of the highest of the three readings. This represents the peak flow, right down the result and report to your study coordinator as it's directed.",

Unfortunately, current evidence doesn't support the use of adjuncts because of their high frequency of false positives, which result in unnecessary complications and costs. When evaluating patients for PMD as an oral cancer, please remember, get to know your patient. During your patient's exam, update their history and have a conversation about oral cancer risk factors. Keep in mind that this could be a stressful situation for the patient. And maybe even for the clinician conducting the exam. Time is important, for potentially malignant lesions by absy or for the patient immediately. Be skeptical of the use of adjuncts. Current evidence does not support the use of these tools in the general population. Please monitor and critically appraised the literature for the emergence of new evidence in the field.

This video offers step-by-step instructions for evaluating adult patients for potentially malignant disorders or PMDs and oral cancer during a routine dental exam near clinic. First, begin the exam by asking your patient if any new dental issues have emerged since the last visit or appointment. During the medical history recollection, pay attention to risk factors such as being male, older, smoking, and alcohol consumption. With the patient's response in mind, next perform a conventional visual intact out into oral and extra oral exam. Throughout the exam, use inspection and pal patient to look for any changes in color, contour, consistency, and function. Begin the extra oral exam by examining the head and face with both the fronts and back. Taking note of any asymmetries and the presence of pigmented lesions. For such lesions, use the American Cancer Society's ABCDE rule to assess for melanoma risk. Look for asymmetry, border irregularity, color changes, diameter greater than 6 millimeters, an evolution of the lesion over time. Next, observe and palpate the neck on both sides. If lymph nodes are identified, pay attention to the size, consistency, whether they are painful and whether they freely move or are fixed in place. When evaluating the lips, note any change in the vermillion border, mucosa, and camasures, as well as the lips' color, contour, consistency, and function. look for indirections and ulceration. Ask your patient to open their mouth and",

Last year, 8,722 adults in the UK were diagnosed with mouth cancer. That's an average of 1 every hour. The number of new cases is doubled in the last 20 years, or more people are losing their life to the disease and cervical cancer and to a particular cancer combined. The key to beating mouth cancer is spotting it quickly, so it's really important everybody knows what the early wanting signs are. Without further ado, let's get into it. Firstly, take a quick look at your face and have a feel for any unusual lump saw bumps around your head and neck. Once that's clear, you can then start checking the inside of your mouth. Check your tongue for any unusual red or white patch lump or an ulcer that has lasted for longer than three weeks. Make sure to check both sides and underneath. Next, run your finger along the inside of both your cheeks. Are there any lumps or bumps? Again, can you see any red or white patches? All clear? Great. Now you should check the roof of your mouth. It can be tricky to get the right angle and you will need to tilt your head back slightly. Also run your finger along the roof of your mouth to check for any lumps or spine. Finally you should then check your lips. Simply use",

These can be signs of potential issues. If everything looks clear, you can proceed to the next step [Video 1: _6csIJAWj_s, Time: 01:37-01:41].\n\n2. **Check the Roof of Your Mouth**: Tilt your head back slightly to get a better view. Use a flashlight if necessary. Run your finger along the roof of your mouth to feel for any lumps or unusual textures. This area can be tricky to inspect, so take your time [Video 1].\n\n3. **Examine Your Lips**: Use your thumb and index finger to gently pull your lips away from your gums. Look for any abnormalities, such as sores or discoloration. This step is crucial as changes in the lips can also indicate potential issues [Video 1].\n\n4. **Safety Considerations**: If you notice any concerning changes, such as persistent sores, lumps, or patches that do not heal, it is essential to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively check for signs of mouth",
